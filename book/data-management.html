<div id="what" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> What</h3>
<p>Clinical Data Management (<strong>CDM</strong>) is the collection, cleaning, and management of subject data in compliance with regulatory standards (Krishnankutty_2012). It is a critical component of clinical research.</p>
</div>
<div id="why" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>The quality of the data generated by the clinical trial will determine the soundness of scientific conclusions formed on the basis of analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="how" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> How</h3>
<p>Data collection and management procedures should be based on sound statistical principles and compliant with the study protocol and regulations. CDM protocol should address key project prerequisites regarding the data collection, storage, protection, retention, and reporting. Potential problems and solutions proposed solutions should be reviewed in detail.</p>
<p>The International Conference On Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E6(R2) recommends that sponsors of clinical trials “implement systems to manage quality throughout the design, conduct, recording, evaluation, reporting, and archiving of clinical trials”… Sponsors should focus on the “human subject protection and reliability of trial results”… To warrant the quality of management “the methods selected to assure and control the quality of the trial need to be proportionate to the risks inherent in the trial and the importance of the information collected” (E6_R2: 5).</p>
<p>The NIH Intramural Research Program Guidelines section on Clinical Informatics, Data Management, and Protocol Tracking rationale and standard states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Collecting clinical data is a complex task that must be integrated into the medical practices of the institution. To monitor the study’s progress and patient safety, data collection is best done as data are generated. Data management organized and supported at the institute level is more efficient and reliable than that left to the individual investigator. There are often unforeseen uses for the kinds of information gathered in the conduct of a clinical trial, and a central database, with appropriate archiving, assures that this information remains the legacy of the institute” </em></p>
<p><em>Each institute sponsoring clinical research should develop a central clinical investigations database that maintains all data specified to be collected in the clinical study (either intervention or natural history). The clinical research information system being continually developed by the Clinical Center interfaces with and supports each institute’s clinical research needs. A confederated database will enable information exchange, enabling access to and sharing of clinical and research information among all institutes. The institutes require data-management infrastructures to maintain their central data registries, to enhance existing databases, to provide eligibility checklists, to record patient randomization and entry into their protocols, to provide report generation, data warehousing, and data entry forms, and to monitor data collection.” (NIH_standars_CR)</em></p>
<p>The NIA <strong>Clinical Research Study Investigator’s Toolbox</strong> provides guidance with specific reference to clinical trials in aging, and in particular useful tips for data management. Investigators pursuing or conducting federally funded projects should make use of this resource (NIA-Guide MOP).</p>

<div id="clinical-data-management-definition-and-procedures" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> CLINICAL Data Management definition and procedures</h2>
<div id="what-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> What</h3>
<p>The clinical data management procedures define the methods and dependent activities in which the clinical data is collected and managed. The procedures content should include the methods used to assign and structure participant’s identifiers (ID), the location of the ID logs, the types of data collection instruments used, a description of how the data is captured/completed, reviewed, cleaned, and subsequently stored/archived.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>Data management procedures that are compliant with the trial’s protocol, good clinical practice (GCP), regulatory requirements, and undergo regular process audits assures the quality of data necessary to execute the planned analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3</span> How</h3>
<p>The data management procedures are often incorporated as a subsection within the Manual of Operations (MOO) or Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). These are executed by project personnel whose portfolio of work includes data management, and who have appropriate professional training and credentials in data science broadly defined. IFAR encourages all investigators and managers to author a MOO or SOP in order to document the project operations including the data management activities (IFAR_sensitive_data_security). As noted above, the NIA toolbox provides general guidance and specific requirements for clinical trials conducted in the field of aging. Harvard Catalyst has a detailed planning checklist that can assist researchers describe the data for protection, IRB submission, and regulatory compliance (Harvard_Catalyst: 5).</p>
<p>Extensive and diverse guidance and examples in other fields are also available online. Some well-executed examples are featured the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) and Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) Clinical Research Center websites.</p>
<div id="systems-for-data-collection-and-management" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3.1</span> Systems for data collection and management</h4>
<p>Clinical trials may use paper-based or electronic data capture, with most studies today using the latter. An electronic data capture (<strong>EDC</strong>) system will be designed to facilitate data collection, often using web-based technology. A Clinical Data Management Systems (<strong>CDMS</strong>) comprises the software tools for data maintenance, quality assurance and reporting. EDC and CDMS may be combined under a single informatics environment.</p>
<p>ICH guideline E6(R2) recommends that the informatics environment allows for both data changes (edits) and detailed trail of audits, data, and editorial information. It also recommends maintaining an SOP for using these systems and a security system that prevents unauthorized access to the data (E6_R2: 5.5).</p>
<p>When describing the data collection system in applications or protocols, data management personnel should define</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The system specifications:</strong> the version number, security system, audit trail, data entry access, the annotated case report forms (CFR), data validation, system failure mitigation plan, and electronic signature features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User acceptance testing:</strong> the proper function of the system. This includes the customized functions, validation checks, the proper assignment of site and/or participant identifications numbers, the cross confirmation of time to events variable delivery, confirmation of data completion, the proper functionality of electronic (e.g. e-mail) alerts, as well as the proper function of role assignments, data exports/imports, and system reports.</p>
<p>Detail concerning specific aspects of procedures governing, and design of, EDC and CDMS are provided in the sections below.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="edccdm-systems-available-at-ifar" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3.1.1</span> EDC/CDM systems available at IFAR</h5>
<p><a href="data-management.html#systems-available-at-ifar">See Appendix I</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data-entry-procedures" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3.2</span> Data entry procedures</h4>
<p>These outline rules for valid data capture. They include the method for determining that a specific form has been completed, for data cleaning and quality assurance, storage procedures, and validation checks designed to ensure that the data capture system operates accurately, reliably, and consistently. With EDC, the designers of the structure may impose rules to maintain data and study quality, ranging from the simple (disallowing, for instance, data falsely labeled with future dates or biological values incompatible with life) to the more complex (for instance, implementation of automated checks of inclusion and exclusion criteria so that ineligible individuals are not enrolled as participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-security-procedures" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3.3</span> Data Security Procedures</h4>
<p>Procedures for maintenance of data security – incorporating both prevention of deletion and prevention of theft – should follow and expand upon the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (<strong>DSMP</strong>) of the study protocol. Details on protocol development are provided in the Essential Documents module.</p>
<p>These procedures should delineate pertinent risks as well as the plan for prevention of theft or loss, including identification of the individuals responsible for maintaining and routinely confirming data security.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning-and-quality-control-procedures" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.4</span> Data cleaning and quality control procedures</h3>
<p>These describe the programmed and/or built-in procedures of the EDC system and CDMS ensuring data validity. Again, automated procedures (e.g. restriction of allowable values to those that match variable definitions) may be employed.</p>
<div id="data-import-and-exports-procedures" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.2.4.1</span> Data import and exports Procedures</h4>
<p>These detail the frequency and methods that are to be used for the loading of data generated outside the EDC system (for instance as measured by a third party laboratory that provides data in a flat file external to the main trial database). Security and preservation of data quality must be accounted for here.</p>
</div>
<div id="case-report-forms-crf" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.2.4.2</span> Case Report Forms (CRF)</h4>
<p>CRF are the ‘source’ documents – which may be electronic forms - for recording the protocol-required information to be reported to the trial’s sponsor on each trial subject.</p>
<p>Paper or electronic documents should be consistent with the source documents (NIH_protocol_template). Investigator must warrant that the case reports be accurate, complete and legible.<br />
<br />
Edits and corrections are to be documented by study personnel with initials and dates, and be available for audits. The corrections should not obscure, however, the original data entry such as the audit trail for either written or electronic data corrections.</p>
<p>At IFAR, the design, analysis, and preparation of the interim and final clinical trial reports should be done with the guidance of the Research Informatics and Biostatistics cores as appropriate.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="monitoring-of-study-participants" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Monitoring Of study participants</h2>
<p>Participant monitoring is a critical task for trial personnel. The CDMS should support and facilitate this task. Some exemplary functions are described below.</p>
<div id="screeningrecruitment" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Screening/Recruitment</h3>
<p>The EDC and CDMS should reinforce the inclusion/exclusion criteria such that only eligible participants are enrolled.</p>
</div>
<div id="randomizationblinding-procedures" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Randomization/Blinding procedures</h3>
<p>The EDC should facilitate assignment of participants to treatments and control regimes in a transparent and error-free manner, while facilitating maintenance of blinding of study personnel as appropriate. See Experimental design and Statistical Considerations module.</p>
</div>
<div id="cessation-of-intervention" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.3</span> Cessation of Intervention</h3>
<p>The CDMS should provide for notation and monitoring of cessation of intervention or other trial procedures as indicated by safety monitoring. Reason for and duration of cessation should be provided, along with other details Note that this is distinct from withdrawal, as described above.</p>
</div>
<div id="withdrawals" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.4</span> Withdrawals</h3>
<p>The CDMS should facilitate the recording of participant withdrawals from the trial. It should capture the reasons for withdrawal, relevant dates and other details. It should also facilitate any additional contact with participants and recording of data relevant to said contacts.</p>
<div id="tracking" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.3.4.1</span> Tracking</h4>
<p>The CDMS should facilitate tracking of participants’ enrollment and progress through the trial consistent with NIH and ICH guidance and with the reporting paradigm laid out in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<strong>CONSORT</strong>) Statement. CONSORT is a set of recommendations for reporting the information for randomized trials including its design, methods, results, and conclusions (Consort). It comprises a 25-item checklist and flow diagram providing guidance for study enrollment, retention, and monitoring as well as derivation of analytic data sets and other data structures.</p>

<div id="reporting" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Reporting</h2>
<p>A basic function of the CDMS is reporting of data and metadata relevant to trial monitoring. Prior to the trial startup the CDM should outline and describe the list of anticipated study reports. Some considerations are:</p>
<div id="safety" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.4.1</span> Safety</h3>
<p>Safety reports should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and with the ICH Guidance for Clinical Safety Data Management (FDA_CDER_CBER: 5.17.2). The parties that must receive the safety reports include all concerned investigator(s)/institutions(s), the IRB(s)/IEC(s) where required, and regulatory authorities. See Human Subjects and Essential Documents modules for detail.</p>
<div id="adverse-events-and-serious-adverse-events." class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.4.1.1</span> Adverse events and Serious Adverse Events.</h4>
<p>The CDMS should facilitate reporting of AEs and SAEs consistent with the study protocol and regulatory requirements (ICH_E2A). Consideration should be given to coding of event expectedness, severity and other relevant qualifications. See Human Subjects and Essential Documents modules.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="screening-and-enrollment" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.4.2</span> Screening and Enrollment</h3>
<p>The EDC and CDMS should be constructed to facilitate regular reporting of study progress, and specifically screening, enrollment and participant visit tracking. A reasonable model for said reports is contained in the DSMB reporting templates provided as part of the NIA Toolbox (<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/startup" class="uri">https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/startup</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="data-quality-and-completeness" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.4.3</span> Data Quality and Completeness</h3>
<p>The EDC and CDSM should be structured to facilitate production of data quality reporting to insure data accuracy, protocol compliance and adherence to regulatory requirements.</p>
</div>
<div id="progress-and-final-reports" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.4.4</span> Progress and Final Reports</h3>
<p>Most federally funded projects require yearly progress and final project reports. State usually done by the PI and grants administrator as they require scientific and administrative progress. Again, data management systems should be structured to interact with statistical software and reporting to facilitate production of these reports.</p>
</div>
<div id="additional-reports" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.4.5</span> Additional Reports</h3>
<p>Project-specific reporting is par for the course in any clinical trial, and will reflect specific complexities of each design. Complex interventions, cluster designs, and numerous other features will necessitate redesign of standard reports or construction of new ones. The EDC and CDMS should be structured to permit easy access to study data and metadata for authoring of said reports within the CDMS or parallel technology (e.g. statistical analysis software).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="trial-documents-and-data-retention" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Trial Documents and Data Retention</h2>
<div id="retention-of-trial-documents." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.5.1</span> Retention of Trial Documents.</h3>
<p>Source data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry and should be explained if necessary (e.g., via an audit trail).</p>
<p>The ICH E6 guidance (FDA_CDER_CBER) recommends that trial documents be kept by the investigator/institution as specified in Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial and as required by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). See Essential Documents module.</p>
</div>

<div id="special-considerations-for-older-subjects" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Special considerations for older subjects</h2>
<p>Section 164.514(a) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule provides the standard for de-identification of protected health information, including that of older subjects. Under this standard, health information is not individually identifiable if it does not identify an individual and if the covered entity has no reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify an individual. For older adults over 89 years of age, states that “all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older” (HHS_hipaa).</p>
<p>As noted above, the NIA Toolbox is an excellent resource for guidance of specific relevance to federal research in aging.</p>
