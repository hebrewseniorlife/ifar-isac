<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> What</h2>
<p>A project management plan is a document that results in a dynamic set of documents that clearly define the goals and provide direction for the project. It articulates the specific deliverables, as well as procedures, timelines, and resources necessary to produce those deliverables, as well as quality measures to meet the required standards. The plan should be based on the scope of the project as defined in the protocol. The following tasks are critical to creating a project management plan:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Define the project goals/deliverables/milestones</p></li>
<li><p>Management using outline-based and/or graphical tools for calendars and schedules</p></li>
<li><p>Management of internal and external communications</p></li>
<li><p>Management of project personnel and responsibilities</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="why-1" class="section level2 ListParagraph">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Why</h2>
<p>A well-designed project plan increases the likelihood of successfully managing a clinical trial. It supports coherent organization, effective management, facilitates transparency, and the detection of foreseeable problems/ issues via monitoring of the project’s critical path. The process and subsequent documentation of all the project progress keeps things focused and moving forward.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-1" class="section level2 ListParagraph">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> How</h2>
<p><strong>Define project goals/ deliverables/ milestones</strong></p>
<p>The project goals, deliverables and milestones are described in the trial protocol. The protocol should be taken as the essential and controlling guide implicating the relevant protocol management activities.</p>
<p><strong>Organizing structure</strong></p>
<p>Project managers should be guided by an overarching structure. For instance, in a large and complex trial with a large number of deliverables, investigators and managers may utilize a formal <strong>Work Breakdown Structure</strong> (WBS). The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition list of necessary tasks, with each descending level representing an increasing detailed definition of the work. Importantly, the WBS is designed to be focused on generation of deliverables, i.e. tangible work-product such as protocols, procedures and study reports. The WBS provides a mechanism to parse deliverables into smaller manageable components; the duration and cost of each step in the process can thus be better established at a granular level.</p>
<p>For a smaller project, it may not be the case that a formal WBS is necessary or efficient, but the <strong>detailed breakdown of specific tasks, along with resources required, is almost never wasted effort</strong>. Thus the following sections outline a system that is almost always relevant to project management, but that may be adopted more or less formally as circumstances dictate. The WBS can be developed using calendaring, graphical and outlining tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="management-using-outline-based-calendars-and-schedules" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Management using outline-based calendars and schedules</h2>
<p>A key component of the project’s success is the management of its schedule. The project manager should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Define all activities required to produce each of the project’s deliverables.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the order or sequence in which the activities must happen and the relationship between them.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish the resources (both human and material) necessary to accomplish each activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Estimate the activity duration.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These items may be applied both at the high level of the project – where, for instance, “develop protocol” might be a single task – as well as at the detailed level, where many tasks necessary to protocol development may be broken out in detail. While the latter is a substantial outlay of resources, it is important to note that the scope of a task and the resources required are more easily estimated for smaller sub-tasks. Accordingly the work invested in breaking out tasks in detail may well be worth it in a complex project.</p>
<p>An example of a simplified schedule specific to protocol development is given in Table X.3; task start and end dates, human resources, and other materials would typically be added to this.</p>
<p><em>Table X.3 Example of a schedule specific to protocol development</em></p>
<table style="width:98%;">
<colgroup>
<col width="98%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><strong>Activity Code</strong> <strong>Activity/ Deliverable</strong> <strong>Duration</strong> <strong>Predecessor / Prerequisite</strong></td>
</tr>

<td align="left"><strong>(days)</strong></td>
</tr>

<p>C Integrate changes 18 B</p>
<p>D Circulate Draft Protocol for final Feedback and Input 14 C</p>
<p>E Finalize Protocol 8 D —————————————————————————————————————————</p>
<p>In the above example, the activities occur in a linear fashion where one must precede the next. Other activities and tasks may more easily and efficiently proceed along multiple, parallel tracks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Management using Graphical Tools</em></strong></p>
<p>Other management tools that may be helpful in creating the project timeline or process maps include flowcharts, Gantt Charts, and network diagrams. We present some examples of the use of these tools below.</p>
<p><strong>Flowcharts</strong> - are graphical depictions of the process flow corresponding to the outline format exemplified by Table X.3. A flowchart replicating Table X.3 would consist of a series of boxes laid out in boringly linear fashion and would therefore be of limited utility. For more complex development along parallel tracks, by contrast, a graphical depiction offers considerable advantages, as shown in Figures X.1 and X.2. These flowcharts depict pretrial, execution and closeout activities at a high level. Once again, each of the components of the activities depicted here could itself be the subject of a detailed tabular or graphical breakdown. A key strength of these organizing tools is their applicability at the level of granular detail and high-level project overview, simultaneously.</p>
<p>The <strong>Network Diagram</strong> is an enhanced flowchart that associates each task with a duration and, potential, anticipated resource expenditures. This is particularly useful in helping the investigative team understand the impact of delays in any task on the overall timeline. Because many tasks have prerequisites while others may be worked on in parallel, it is not the case that delays in different tasks will have similar impact.<br />
<br />
A useful concept, therefore, is the <strong>critical path</strong> of the project. This is defined as the longest sequence of tasks stretching from project start to finish. It has the feature that account for the fact that in delays in any of the activities along the path will lead delay completion of the project, unless this delay can be made up elsewhere along the critical path. These concepts are illustrated in Figure X.3.</p>
<p><em>Figure X.3. The project critical path is outline in orange; any delays along this path imply an elongation of the total project duration. </em></p>

<div id="management-of-internal-and-external-communications" class="section level2 ListParagraph">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Management of internal and external communications</h2>
<p>Key elements of the communications plan include:</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities for communication. </strong></p>
<p>The management team should assist in developing a schedule of interactions between members of the investigative team, as well as with internal and external stakeholders. This should include transmission of formal reports, and also the times, locations, duration, and attendees of meetings and other interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Means of communications.</strong></p>
<p>The management team should assist in procuring, testing and maintaining the means of project communications. These should be chosen such that capabilities correspond to project needs. Ease of use and reliability are additional key features that must be emphasized.</p>
<p><strong>Recording of communications and trial progress. </strong></p>
<p>The project management team should take an active role in maintenance of the record of communications, including meeting minutes and agendas. Under some scenarios, stakeholders (e.g. funding agencies) may reserve the right to determine the official level of high-level interactions, in which case the management team may contribute as appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div id="management-of-project-personnel-and-responsibilities" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Management of project personnel and responsibilities</h2>
<p>The management team should develop a roster of personnel based on the roles and responsibilities of team members. Ideally this will identify the individuals primarily responsible (i.e. those that execute the work) and accountable (i.e. those ultimately answerable for the completion) for each function and task. Teams may additionally elect to identify -those who have secondary responsibilities relating to consulting on, or approval of, specific tasks and functions.</p>
