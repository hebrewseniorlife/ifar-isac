<div id="purpose-of-toolkit" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Purpose of toolkit</h2>
<p>This toolkit is a <em>general</em> guide for investigators and project staff at Hebrew SeniorLife Institute for Aging Research (HSL IFAR) conducting, managing or overseeing clinical trials in older populations. The toolkit is not intended be a comprehensive document. Rather it is meant to outline major considerations for all phases of a clinical trial. Suggested resources are provided for more detailed information <strong>and you must consult and adhere to the latest federal, sponsor, institutional, state and regional regulations.</strong></p>
<p>Whenever possible, sections of this toolkit follow a similar outline: What, Why, How, Special Considerations for Aging Populations, Common Pitfalls, and Resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="are-you-are-doing-a-clinical-trial" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Are you are doing a clinical trial?</h2>
<p>Below is the National Institutes of Health (NIH) definition of a clinical trial. As clinical trials are subject to additional oversight, a clear definition helps investigators ensure that they are meeting all of their obligations, and help funders ensure that the additional oversight is occurring when it is needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A research study<sup>1 </sup>in which one or more human subjects<sup>2</sup> are prospectively assigned<sup>3</sup> to one or more interventions<sup>4</sup> (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.<sup>5</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><sup>1</sup>See Common Rule definition of </em>research* at 45 CFR 46.102(d).*</p>
<p><em><sup>2</sup>See Common Rule definition of </em>human subject* at 45 CFR 46.102(f).*</p>
<p><em><sup>3</sup>“Prospectively assigned” refers to a pre-defined process (e.g., randomization) specified in a protocol that stipulates the assignment of research subjects (individually or in clusters) to one or more arms of a clinical trial.</em></p>
<p><em><sup>4</sup>An intervention is defined as a manipulation of the subject or subject’s environment for the purpose of modifying one or more health-related biomedical or behavioral processes and/or endpoints.  Examples include:  drugs/small molecules/compounds; biologics; devices; procedures (e.g., surgical techniques); delivery systems (e.g., telemedicine); strategies to change health-related behavior (e.g., diet, cognitive therapy, exercise); treatment strategies; prevention strategies; and, diagnostic strategies.</em></p>
<p><em><sup>5</sup>Health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome is defined as the pre-specified goal(s) or condition(s) that reflect the effect of one or more interventions on human subjects’ biomedical or behavioral status or quality of life.  Examples include:  positive or negative changes to physiological or biological parameters (e.g., improvement of lung capacity); positive or negative changes to psychological or neurodevelopmental parameters (e.g., mood management intervention for smokers; reading comprehension and /or information retention); positive or negative changes to disease processes; positive or negative changes to health-related behaviors; and, positive or negative changes to quality of life.</em></p>

</div>
<div id="clinical-trial-phases" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Clinical Trial Phases</h2>
<p>Clinical trials are conducted in a series of steps, called phases - each phase is designed to answer a separate research question. These phases mostly apply to trials testing drugs or devices, rather than behavioral interventions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phase I:</strong> Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase II:</strong> The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase III:</strong> The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase IV:</strong> Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug’s/treatment’s effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use.</p></li>

<div id="training-requirements-and-opportunities" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Training requirements and opportunities:</h2>
<p>Aside from clinical trial design and/or biostatistical training, there are varied practical, short-term courses for principal investigators and project personnel to enhance the conduct and rigor of their clinical trials.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Good Clinical Practice</strong> (<strong>GCP</strong>) is an international quality standard that defines standards for clinical trials involving human subjects. <strong>The NIH require C</strong><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-148.html#_ftn2"><strong>ertifications in Good Clinical Practice</strong></a> <strong>for NIH-funded Investigators and clinical trial site staff who are responsible for the conduct, management and oversight of NIH-funded clinical trials. The FDA has a similar requirement.</strong> Below is a link to its training that fulfils this requirement: <a href="https://gcplearningcenter.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx" class="uri">https://gcplearningcenter.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>There are many other extensive courses offered to become GCP certified, both internet-based and on-site. Most have a tuition cost. It is a good idea, if resources are available, for Project Directors leading clinical trials to receive GCP certification. Below are examples of a few of these many opportunities.</p>
<p><a href="https://gcp.nihtraining.com/" class="uri">https://gcp.nihtraining.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.onlinegcp.us/" class="uri">http://www.onlinegcp.us/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.citiprogram.org/index.cfm?pageID=90" class="uri">https://www.citiprogram.org/index.cfm?pageID=90</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Harvard Catalyst Clinical Trial Design:</strong> Clinical Trial Design is an opportunity for new clinical investigators, who have an idea for development of a clinical trial, to participate in an intensive eight-week course. It is offered at <em>no cost</em> to members of the Harvard Catalyst community or other Clinical and Translational Science Award(CTSA) usually in May/June, with an application due in March. Participants learn the fundamentals of clinical trial design, including instructions on how to design a protocol, information on IRB and regulatory topics, and on trial implementation. Additional course topics include statistical analysis, budgeting, and data management. <a href="https://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/ctd/" class="uri">https://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/ctd/</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>NIH Clinical Research Training On-Line:</strong> On-line course available 24/day at no cost with the following objectives: i. To raise awareness of the ethical issues involved in human subjects research; ii. To become familiar with the roles and responsibilities of the principal investigator and the institution when conducting clinical research in the NIH intramural research program; iii. To have an understanding of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight of clinical research; and iv. To become familiar with how developments in science and health are reported by the media and how to work effectively with reporters.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Clinical Trial Planning Resources</h2>
<p>Numerous resources are available to researchers as they plan and proceed with their clinical trial.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>One such resources is **“The NIA Clinical Trial Toolbox: A resource for quality studies** (<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/blog/2016/10/nia-clinical-trial-toolbox-resource-quality-studies" class="uri">https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/blog/2016/10/nia-clinical-trial-toolbox-resource-quality-studies</a>). This toolbox provides researchers with a central source of materials to develop and manage clinical trials. The site includes: templates, forms, guidelines and other related information that can be very helpful throughout the research process and is referenced throughout the ISAC toolkit</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> General Considerations about federal regulations</h3>
<p>The regulation of clinical trials can be complex. What may be seen by investigators as trivial regulations or minor misdemeanors can have serious consequences for the individual investigator, their institutions, sponsors, and trial subjects. Therefore, it is wise to be over-cautious and anticipate problems before they arise. <strong>As regulatory issues can play a critical role in your trial design, it is strongly advised to consider these issues from the very start of project planning (e.g. grant preparation) by consulting with your institutional review board (IRB), and making sure you understand existing regulations and institutional policies</strong>.</p>
<p>Federal agencies including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS (includes National Institutes of Health (NIH)), make and enforce regulations to ensure the safety of participants in clinical trials, and retain final authority for determining whether an institution has been compliant. <strong>Investigators should review the specific regulations of the funding or over-seeing agency and confer with the IRB to determine whether additional regulations or policies apply. The investigator must keep in mind that when more than one regulation, guidance, or policy applies the most stringent must be followed.</strong></p>
<p><em>HHS regulated trials (includes NIH):</em> HHS requirements for federally funded human subjects’ research is codified in 45 CFR Part 46 “Protection of Human Subjects” (<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/" class="uri">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/</a>). This set of regulations are based on the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/">Belmont Report</a></p>
<p><em>FDA Regulated Trials:</em> The FDA has their own set of human subject regulations and regulations CFR – Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 governing IRB activities, which goes beyond the scope of this module. A key initial step is to determine whether or not your trial falls under the regulatory jurisdiction of the FDA which generally oversees drug and device trials. For more information check <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/ucm155713.htm">FDA regulations</a>.</p>
<p><em>Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP):</em> The OHRP is the federal body responsible for compliance monitoring. Under Title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 281 et seq.), OHRP has the authority to investigate complaints about human subject protections in HHS-funded research, or other research covered by the institution’s Assurance of Compliance. For general regulatory issues, particularly for federally funded trials, refer to the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/">OHRP website</a>.</p>
<p><em>International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP):</em> While federal regulations provide the standards by which human subjects research is to be conducted, guidance documents and institutional policies add specificity and provide direction on how to apply regulatory requirements. One such guidance is the ICH GCP guidance Compliance with the ICH GCP assures that the rights and well-being of trial subjects are protected and that the clinical trial data are credible.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Institutional Review Board (IRB)</h2>
<div id="what" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> What</h3>
<p>An institutional review board (IRB) is an appropriately constituted group formally designated to review, approve and monitor research involving human subjects to ensure it is conducted in accordance with applicable federal regulations, institutional policies, and ethical guidelines.</p>
<p>While all IRBs are responsible to adhere to the same regulations as defined by <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy">OHRP</a>, (<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy" class="uri">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy</a>.), each IRB is required to have its own institutional policies and operates differently. It is critical to understand the requirements of the IRB overseeing your project. Specific information relevant to HSL IRB can be found on the IRB section of the <a href="http://www.instituteforagingresearch.org/resources/research-administration/institutional-review-board">HSL website</a> (<a href="http://www.instituteforagingresearch.org/resources/research-administration/institutional-review-board" class="uri">http://www.instituteforagingresearch.org/resources/research-administration/institutional-review-board</a>) as well as the: <a href="http://thehslhub/Departments/Roslindale/HSL-IFAR/Institutional-Review-Board">internal HSL “HUB”</a> (<a href="http://thehslhub/Departments/Roslindale/HSL-IFAR/Institutional-Review-Board" class="uri">http://thehslhub/Departments/Roslindale/HSL-IFAR/Institutional-Review-Board</a>).</p>
<div id="categories-of-irb-oversight" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.1</span> Categories of IRB oversight</h4>
<p>Depending on the study design and degree to which human subjects are involved, the IRB will review the research and will make a determination on the appropriate review level. The basic levels of review include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exempt (determination by IRB Chair or her designee)</li>
<li>Expedited (review/approval by IRB Chair or her designee)</li>
</ul>
<p>Full Board (review/approval by the convened IRB) Most clinical trials will require full IRB review.</p>
</div>
<div id="irb-applications-and-reviews" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.2</span> IRB Applications and Reviews</h4>
<p>IRB applications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial application</li>
<li>Annual/continuing review</li>
<li>Amendments/modifications to the protocol or study materials</li>
<li>Incident Reports for:
<ul>
<li>Unanticipated problems</li>
<li>Non-Compliance</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div id="initial-review-of-research-application" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.2.1</span> Initial Review of Research Application</h5>
<p>All human subjects’ research must be reviewed and approved by an IRB before human subjects activities can begin. This includes recruitment efforts, and receiving or collecting data. Per Federal and Institutional policy, no funds for research involving human subjects activities will be released until the appropriate IRB approval has been secured.</p>
</div>
<div id="annualcontinuing-review" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.2.2</span> Annual/Continuing Review</h5>
<p>Investigators must receive continuing approval of their research at least annually. On some occasions, more frequent review may be required by the IRB. Continuing approval is required until all activities with human subjects are complete (this includes access to data with participant identifiers or with codes that can be linked back to research participants).</p>
</div>
<div id="amendment-submissions" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.2.3</span> Amendment Submissions</h5>
<p>Investigators must submit all changes to the research or research materials and receive IRB approval for those changes prior to implementation (except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to research participants).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="why" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>The IRB assures that a clinical trial is in compliance with federal and state regulations, institutional policies, and accepted ethical guidelines, to protect the rights and welfare of research subjects.</p>
</div>
<div id="how" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> How</h3>
<div id="irb-review-for-single-site-trials" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3.1</span> IRB Review for Single Site Trials</h4>
<p>The procedures for IRB review differ by institution but have common main elements. It is wise before you embark on your IRB application to consult with the IRB office to review the general study design and anticipate key review considerations.</p>
<p>The HSL IFAR IRB uses an electronic submissions system (Cayuse). Forms are templated and will guide you through the required elements. Application submissions must meet deadlines stipulated in the <a href="http://thehslhub/~/media/HSLNet/Docs/IFAR/IRB/IRB_SOP.ashx">HSL IFAR IRB Standard Operating Procedures</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="irb-review-for-multi-site-trials" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3.2</span> IRB Review for Multi-Site Trials</h4>
<p>Many clinical trials involve multiple sites and/or investigators from multiple institutions. Many clinical trials involve multiple sites that are clearly engaged in human subjects’ research (i.e., site personnel are recruiting subjects, implementing an intervention, or collecting data). Regulatory oversight of these trials can be done either by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single IRB review (one IRB reviews the research, and the other IRBs rely on the reviewing IRB)</li>
<li>Multiple IRB reviews (e.g. each institution conducts its own IRB review/approval)</li>
</ul>
<p>In June 2016, the NIH established a <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-094.html">policy</a> effective May 25, 2017, requiring a single IRB for all NIH-funded multisite studies, with only rare exceptions.</p>
<p>IRBs of engaged sites and investigators may cede oversight responsibility to the IRB reviewing the research (also referred to as the IRB of record). Relying on an external IRB, or ceded review, is documented with a formal agreement between the reviewing and relying site IRBs and must be signed by an Institutional Official. Note: If you are conducting research with Harvard affiliates, you may rely on the Harvard Catalyst Reliance Agreement, rather than an IRB Authorization Agreement. See the HSL IRB office for more information.</p>
<p>Some study sites engaging in human subjects’ research (e.g., community nursing homes) may not be associated with an IRB. In this case the reviewing IRB may agree to provide IRB oversight for the external site through a formalized agreement (Individual Investigator Agreement) between the two parties. Alternatively, a commercial IRB may be engaged in a contract to provide oversight for that external site. Sites that receive direct federal awards for research purposes may also need a <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/fwas/fwa-protection-of-human-subjecct/index.html">FederalWide Assurances</a>. These determinations will be made by the prime IRB responsible for the trial.</p>

<div id="special-considerations-for-older-subjects" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Special considerations for older subjects</h3>
<p>There are two special considerations for special protections governing research with elderly subjects: cognitive impairment and institutionalization. Under those conditions, a number of issues must be taken into consideration. See <a href="http://archive.hhs.gov/ohrp/irb/irb_chapter6.htm">OHRPs related guidance</a> and <a href="http://thehslhub/~/media/HSLNet/Docs/IFAR/IRB/IRB_SOP.ashx">HSL IRB’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</a>. <em>See also Informed Consent Section related to the decision making capacity section 7.4)</em>:</p>
</div>
<div id="common-pitfalls" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Common Pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not seeking IRB guidance in the process of trial design and well in advance of your planned start date.</li>
<li>Underestimating the time it takes to get IRB approval.</li>
<li>Underestimating regulatory requirements. Failure to meet requirements could lead to serious consequences for yourself and your institution. Be overly cautious and always report anything of potential concern to your IRB.</li>
<li>Flippant or casual comments about human subjects’ or regulatory issues about your trial via emails or text. If a problem occurs, all related communication may be become eventually become relevant.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</h2>
<div id="what-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> What</h3>
<p>The HIPAA, enacted through the Privacy Rule, establishes national standards for the protection of protected health information (PHI). The rule establishes conditions under which PHI may be used by covered entities<sup>1</sup>, including for research<sup>2</sup> purposes. With regards to research, the Privacy Rule also defines the means by which individuals should be informed of uses of their medical information for research purposes, and their rights to access information about them held by covered entities.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup><em><strong>Covered entities</strong>: health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers who transmit any health information in connection with transactions for which HHS has adopted standards.</em></p>
<p><sup>2</sup><em><strong>Research</strong>: Defined in the Privacy Rule “a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” </em></p>
</div>
<div id="why-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>The Privacy Rule protects the privacy of individually identifiable health information, while at the same time ensuring that researchers have access to medical information necessary to conduct vital research.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> How</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/">Privacy Rule</a> builds upon the protections provided to human subjects in the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/common-rule/">Common Rule (45 CFR Part 46, Subpart A)</a>, and/or the <a href="http://osp.od.nih.gov/office-clinical-research-and-bioethics-policy/clinical-research-policy/research-involving-human-subjects">Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) human subject protection regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56)</a>. There are three main areas for researchers to consider:</p>
<div id="screening-patients-for-recruitment" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3.1</span> Screening patients for recruitment</h4>
<p>Selection of subjects for a clinical trial often requires identifying patients with specific characteristics (e.g., a diagnosis) from a large patient population using data considered PHI. To facilitate such efforts, covered entities are permitted to use and disclose PHI for research purposes pursuant to a waiver of authorization by an IRB or Privacy Board. At HSL, the IRB also serves as the Privacy Board</p>
</div>
<div id="inclusion-of-hipaa-assurances-in-informed-consent-forms" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3.2</span> Inclusion of HIPAA assurances in informed consent forms</h4>
<p>When PHI is being used in a research study, the consent form must include core elements and essential language for authorization of use of PHI as defined by the Privacy Rule (see Privacy Rule, 45 C.F.R. §164.508(c)(1)). At HSL, the required language is included in the Informed Consent Template available in the online IRB application system Cayuse. <strong>Investigators should not alter these templates without consulting the IRB.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="handling-of-phi-throughout-the-trial" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3.3</span> Handling of PHI throughout the trial</h4>
<p>A core tenant of HIPAA and the use of PHI is to use the minimum necessary information in order to maintain and protect patient privacy. As such, clinical trials must be designed and conducted to minimize unnecessary data collection and maximize subject confidentiality. Whenever possible, information obtained from patients or their medical records should be collected without identifiers. When identifiable data is collected, the protocol must be designed to maintain confidentiality of identifiable data, and data security measures appropriate to the degree of risk from disclosure.</p>
<p>A complete summary of key elements of the Privacy Rule including who is covered, what information is protected, and how PHI can be used and disclosed is presented in the “<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html">Summary of the HIPAA Privacy Rule</a>.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> What</h3>
<p>A data use agreement (DUA) is a contractual agreement required under the Privacy Rule between a HIPAA covered entity (e.g., HSL) and a third party who wishes to obtain PHI with limited identifiers, referred to as a Limited Data Set (LDS). DUAs address issues such as limitations on use of the data, obligations to safeguard the data, liability for harm arising from the use of the data, publication, and privacy rights that are associated with transfers of confidential or protected data. Refer to <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/eplc/EPLC%20Archive%20Documents/55-Data%20Use%20Agreement%20(DUA)/eplc_dua_practices_guide.pdf">HIPAA, Section 45 CFR part 160 Subparts A and E of Part 164</a> for details. A common example of a study that requires a DUA, is one that utilizes Medicare data for which a DUA must be set up with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. See resources below for guidance.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-2" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>In addition to the requirements set forth in the Privacy Rule, a DUA clearly establishes the rules and expectations related to provision and use of data by the involved parties (provider and recipient). DUA must be entered into <em>before</em> there is any use or disclosure of a limited data set to an outside institution or party.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION</h2>
<div id="what-3" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> What</h3>
<p>ClinicalTrials.gov is an on-line public registry of clinical trials maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Library of Medicine. It was launched in 2000 and expanded by the Federal Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA 801) in 2007 and is endorsed by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).</p>
<div id="which-trials-must-be-registered" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1.1</span> Which Trials Must be Registered?</h4>
<p>It is strongly recommended that ALL clinical trials are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. By law, only trials that meet the FDAAA 801 definition of an “applicable clinical trial” must be registered which generally include interventional studies (with one or more arms) of FDA-regulated drugs, biological products, or devices. However, in 2014, the NIH proposed expanding clinicaltrials.gov registration requirements to include all NIH-funded clinical trials. Thus, even clinical trials in which the intervention is a behavior modification or clinical education program merits registration on ClinicalTrials.org<strong>. It is strongly recommended that ALL clinical trials are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.</strong></p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.2.1</span> Required by Law</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-110publ85/pdf/PLAW-110publ85.pdf#page=82">Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA 801)</a> requires Responsible Parties to register and submit summary results of clinical trials with ClinicalTrials.gov. The law applies to certain clinical trials of drugs (including biological products) and medical devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="required-for-journal-publication" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.2.2</span> Required for Journal Publication</h4>
<p>The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/publishing-and-editorial-issues/clinical-trial-registration.html">requires trial registration</a> as a condition of the publication of research results generated by a clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov is a registry where organizations and individuals can provide the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/trds/en/index.html">Trial Registration Data Set</a> required by ICMJE. Top tier journals will scrutinize the registration of your trial on ClinicalTrials.gov and make sure that is aligns with the description provided in your paper. <strong>Most journals have a strict requirement that your trial be registered no more within 21 days after enrollment of the first participant and will reject your paper it is this is not the case.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="how-3" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.3</span> How</h3>
<p>Trial registry is done on the ClinicalTrials.gov. Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS). The PI (and in some circumstances, a lead person on the study team) should be assigned as the Responsible Party charged with initiating and maintaining the registration. Once submitted by the PI, institutional administrators (the HSL IRB Director at IFAR) are notified of the submission and must verify the information in the registration (including changes and updates to the study) and approve and release it before it is sent to administrators at ClinicalTrials.gov for review and eventual posting.</p>
<div id="initial-submission" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.3.1</span> Initial submission</h4>
<p>The clinical trial must be registered no later than 21 days after enrollment of the first participant. Note this rule is strictly enforced by major journals.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> DATA SAFETY MONITORING</h2>
<div id="what-4" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1</span> What</h3>
<p>Funding agencies require that the safety of trial participants and integrity of data are ensured through systems of research oversight and monitoring. The type and level of monitoring required depends on the risk, nature, size and complexity of the clinical trial. It can be as simple as basic monitoring by the PI, an independent safety officer or medical monitor, or an NIH officer, or as complex as a full independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). <strong>The decision about the level of data safety monitoring required for your study is ordinarily determined by the sponsor (i.e., NIH), but it may also be required by the IRB.</strong> The remainder of this module assumes your trial requires full DSMB.</p>
<p>The DSMB is a formally appointed independent group, consisting of at least three (3) voting members external to the research that typically include experts in the relevant field of study, statistics, and study design. The clinical trial PI(s) and lead statistician also typically participate as internal members on the DSMB.</p>
<p>The DSMB conducts interim monitoring of accumulating data from research activities to assure the continuing safety of human subjects, relevance of the study question, appropriateness of the study, and integrity of the accumulating data.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-4" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>The purpose of a DSMB is to ensure the safety of human subjects, relevance of the study question, appropriateness of the study, and integrity of the accumulating data. Additionally, the DSMB attempts to identify threats to credibility or the validity of the study related to slow rates of accrual, high rates of ineligibility after randomization, high rates of protocol violations, and unexpectedly high dropout rates.</p>
<p>The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodic review and evaluation of the accumulated study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and, when appropriate, efficacy.</li>
<li>Provision of written documentation confirming review of the protocol and agreement with the study design and the data safety monitoring plan (DSMP).</li>
<li>Make recommendations to study sponsor concerning the continuation, modification, unmasking or termination of the trial.</li>
<li>Provide a written report to the IRB which summarizes oversight activities and recommendations, and any concerns regarding subject safety.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="how-4" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3</span> How</h3>
<p>There are four basic steps in establishing a trial’s Data Safety Monitoring system:</p>
<div id="establish-a-data-safety-monitoring-plan-dsmp" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3.1</span> Establish a Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)</h4>
<p>The PI should create a Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) that is appropriate for the type and expected risks of the research. The DSMP must be included with the protocol in the initial submission to the IRB. <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/data-and-safety-monitorin">Templates of DSMPs</a> are available on the NIH website<em>. DSMPs</em> generally include the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data or events to be captured under the monitoring provisions (e.g., unanticipated problems and adverse events)</li>
<li>The entity responsible (e.g., investigators, sponsor, a coordinating or statistical center, an independent monitor, DSMB) for monitoring the data collected and the time frames for reporting</li>
<li>The frequency of assessments of data or events captured by the monitoring provisions</li>
<li>Definition of specific triggers or stopping rules that dictate when action is required</li>
<li>Procedures for communicating to the IRB(s), the study sponsor, the investigator(s), and other appropriate officials the outcome of the reviews by the monitoring entity.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="establish-the-dsmb-membership" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3.2</span> Establish the DSMB membership</h4>
<p>For NIH-funded studies, the Program Official (PO) holds primary responsibility for the formation of the DSMB and selecting the external members unless otherwise specified in the Terms of Award. External DSMB members should not have direct involvement in the conduct of the study or any financial, proprietary, professional, or other interests that may affect their impartiality. Study investigators should have opportunity to review the proposed members before the candidate’s interest and availability are confirmed.</p>
<p>Once the group has been formed, the PO will select the DSMB Chair. All external DSMB must sign a Conflict of Interest certification that should be kept in the Essential Documents binder. Each IRB should be informed of the membership and operating procedures.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-dsmb-charter" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3.3</span> Create DSMB Charter</h4>
<p>Before the trial begins a DSMB charter must be prepared that details the roles and responsibilities of the DSMB. The charter is usually drafted by the PO and subject to approval by PIs and DSMB members (see section 5.1 in Essential Documents that details the contents of the DSMB Charter) (link). The DSMB Charter should be maintained in the Essential Documents binder.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-dsmb-report-templates-and-meeting-documentation" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3.4</span> Create DSMB Report Templates and Meeting Documentation</h4>
<p>The next step is for the research team to work with the DSMB members to create templates for the Open and Closed Sessions of the DSMB meetings. Templates for these reports are described in section 5.2 of the Essential Documents section <span class="math display">\[add link\]</span>. Finally, a system to maintain agendas and minutes from the DSMB meetings should be established. All DSMB reports, agendas and minutes must be maintained in the Essential Documents binder.</p>
</div>
<div id="establish-meeting-schedule-and-structure" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3.5</span> Establish Meeting Schedule and Structure</h4>
<p><em>Prior to the start of the trial</em>, the DSMB should convene as many times as needed to review the protocol and approve all data safety monitoring protocols, templates of essential documents, and processes for conducting the business of the DSMB (e.g., schedule, voting rules, minutes, definition of a quorum).</p>
<p>Unless otherwise determined, the PO is responsible for convening meetings, and coordinating the distribution of materials to DSMB members and other meeting participants prior to the meeting. The agenda for each meeting is generally developed jointly by the PO, the PI (s) (regardless of whether a contract, cooperative agreement, or grant), the study statistician, and DSMB Chair. These details of these responsibilities should be agreed upon by the PO and PI (s).</p>
<p>Once a study has started, most DSMBs meet every 6 months, but at least annually. Additional DSMB meetings may be requested by DSMB members, the PO, collaborators, IRB, or PI at any time and up to the discretion of the PO and DSMB Chair.</p>
<p>Meetings may be held by telephone, videoconferences or in-person In the event a DSMB member cannot attend a meeting, he/she may receive a copy of the closed session DSMB report (see below) and either participate by conference call or provide written comments to the DSMB Chair for consideration at the meeting.</p>
<div id="dsmb-meeting-format" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3.5.1</span> DSMB Meeting Format</h5>
<p>The recommended meeting format consists of three sessions: Open Session, Closed Session, and Closed Executive Session.</p>
<p><strong>A. Open Session <em>(</em></strong><em>see <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/data-and-safety-monitoring" class="uri">https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/data-and-safety-monitoring</a> for report template)</em>: This session is generally attended by the PI (s), project statistician, external DSMB members, and the PO. The opens session basically involves a complete review and discussion of all the elements in the open session report presented in the aggregate for both arms of the study.</p>
<p><strong>B. Closed Session <em>(</em></strong><em>see <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/data-and-safety-monitoring" class="uri">https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/data-and-safety-monitoring</a> for report template)</em>: Generally only external voting members attend this meeting. However the DSMB may invite others to participate. The data reviewed in the closed session is similar to that presented in the open session, but is presented by study-arm in a semi-blinded fashion. For example, the arms are NOT identified by control or intervention, but as group 1 and group 2. If a study has an interim analysis with a pre-determined stopping rule, outcomes with statistical comparisons are also discussed in the closed session.</p>
<p><strong>C. Closed Executive Session</strong>: This final session involves only DSMB voting members to ensure complete objectivity as they discuss outcome results, make decisions, and formulate recommendations regarding the study. If treatment codes have been made accessible to the DSMB, then the DSMB may unmask the data based on procedures identified in advance.</p>
</div>
<div id="voting" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3.5.2</span> Voting</h5>
<p>To hold a vote, a quorum, as defined by the DSMB in the initial meeting, must be present either in person or by conference call. After a thorough discussion, the final recommendations of each DSMB member should be solicited in Closed Executive Session. A consensus recommendation among members is not required. The final recommendations are identified as majority or minority positions and are accompanied by actual vote tallies for each divergent recommendation, i.e., as number of votes for or against a particular action, such as continuing or terminating a study, etc.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the meeting, the DSMB sends their recommendations to the PO and PI as to whether the study should continue without change, be modified, or terminated. Recommendations could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Modifications of the study protocol</p></li>
<li><p>Suspension or early termination of the study or of one or more study arms because of serious concerns about subjects’ safety, inadequate performance or rate of enrollment</p></li>
<li><p>Suspension or early termination of the study or of one or more study arms because study objectives have been obtained according to pre-established statistical guidelines</p></li>
<li><p>Corrective actions regarding a study center whose performance appears unsatisfactory or suspicious.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Investigator must submit the DSMBs summary report to the IRB and any other site investigators for distribution to other IRBs as necessary as soon as it is available. DSMB/C reports should include a statement indicating that the data have been reviewed, the date of review and a summary of specific findings of the research study. If it is an FDA-regulated trial the summary report must be forwarded to the FDA.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> INFORMED CONSENT</h2>
<div id="what-5" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.1</span> What</h3>
<p>Informed consent is the process by which a volunteer who wishes to participate in a research study is informed about the study and agrees to participate in the study. Informed consent is a process that generally starts with the recruitment of volunteers and continues often times throughout the course of a study.</p>
<p>Informed consent is a critical and complex regulatory component of human subjects’ research, a full discussion of which goes beyond the scope of this module. <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">Sections 45 CFR §46.116 and 45 CFR §46.117 of the Code of Federal Regulations</a> Protection of Human Subjects addresses informed consent. There are many other resources that provide a thorough review of this topic, several of which, including the <a href="http://thehslhub/~/media/HSLNet/Docs/IFAR/IRB/IRB_SOP.ashx">HSL IRB SOPs</a> are provided at the end of the module.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-5" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>Informed consent is required under federal regulations for all non-exempt research unless certain criteria are met to waive informed consent requirements. The goal of the informed consent process is to provide sufficient information so that participants can make informed decisions about whether or not to enroll in a study or to continue or to withdraw their participation.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-5" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3</span> How</h3>
<div id="who-obtains-consent" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3.1</span> Who Obtains Consent?</h4>
<p>The act of consenting participants may be completed by a trained member of the research team, often a research nurse or assistant. However, the PI bears responsibility for ensuring that informed consent is obtained properly.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-gives-consent" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3.2</span> Who Gives Consent?</h4>
<p>Consent is usually obtained from intended participants. However when the intended participant lacks decision making capacity (e.g., too ill or cognitively impaired) consent may be obtained from the intended participant’s proxy or “legally authorized representative” (LAR) under certain circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div id="mode-of-consent" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3.3</span> Mode of Consent</h4>
<p>The mode of obtaining consent varies depending on the nature of the study and study population. The gold standard is written consent, however obtaining written informed consent is not always feasible or the best choice for the research project. In these cases, with the guidance and approval of the IRB, some or all aspects of informed consent may be altered or waived. See also <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">45</a> <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">CFR 46.116 sections C and D, and 45 CFR 46.117 section C</a> of the Code of Federal Regulations Protection of Human Subjects.</p>
<div id="written-informed-consent-forms" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3.3.1</span> Written Informed Consent Forms</h5>
<p>A written consent form serves multiple purposes. It is a legal document of consent, it can provide a helpful “script” during the process of obtaining consent, and serves as a resource that participants can keep and refer to throughout the study. Each institution’s IRB has specific requirements and templates for written consent forms that must be adhered to.</p>
</div>
<div id="waiver-of-consent" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3.3.2</span> Waiver of consent</h5>
<p>There are very specific regulations that provide for circumstances under which informed consent, or elements of informed consent, may be waived. The determination of a waiver of consent is made by the overseeing IRB. Also see <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">45 CFR 46.116 sections C and D, and 45 CFR 46.117 section C</a> of the Code of Federal Regulations Protection of Human Subjects.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of cases, a waiver of consent is only possible for clinical trials that meet the criteria for a “<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html#46.102">minimal risk</a>” study as defined in the Code of Federal Regulation, Protection of Human subjects at (<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.102">45 CFR §46.102(i)</a>) *“**Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests*.”</p>
<p>Whether or not a clinical trial meets criteria for a waiver of informed consent has very important implications for the study design including its timeline, budget, and personnel requirements. Thus, even in the grant preparation stage you should consult with your IRB to get guidance on this issue.</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3.4.1</span> Informed consent in cluster RCTs</h5>
<p>In <a href="http://www.cochrane-net.org/openlearning/html/modA2-4.htm">cluster RCTs</a>the unit of random assignment is a group (the “cluster”), such as a clinic, hospital, physician practice or even a geographical region, rather than an individual. This increasingly used design in health services research raises many special ethical and regulatory considerations, including informed consent. (See <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001346">The Ottawa Statement on Ethical Design and Conduct of Cluster Randomized Trials</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3184061/pdf/1745-6215-12-202.pdf">When is Informed Consent Required in Cluster randomized trial in health research?</a> and “<a href="http://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-12-100">Ethical issues posed by cluster RCTs</a>,”</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS</h2>
<p>There are numerous entities under which there is regulatory guidance on classifying and reporting unanticipated problems and adverse events (AEs), including the prime IRB, OHRP, NIH, HHS, and FDA. Investigators must be apprised of the guidelines specific to their IRB and agencies overseeing the trial.</p>
<div id="pre-trial-preparation-for-adverse-event-monitoring-and-reporting" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.1</span> Pre-trial preparation for Adverse Event monitoring and reporting</h3>
<p>Investigators must include a plan for defining, detecting, monitoring and reporting any AEs that might occur in study subjects, including the type, probability and expected level of severity. The investigator should include a risk profile of the proposed research study as well as a description of how the risks of the research will be minimized and the plan for safety monitoring. Additionally, a description of potential AEs must be included in the manual of operating procedures, all regulatory/human subjects documents, DSMB, and consent forms.</p>
</div>
<div id="reporting-processes-around-aes-and-unanticipated-problems" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.2</span> Reporting Processes around AEs and Unanticipated problems</h3>
<p>All AEs experienced by study participants and all unanticipated problems must be documented and reported as described in the study protocol. Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Unanticipated Problems have specific definitions, reporting procedures and reporting requirements that may vary by sponsor, internal IRB requirements and study risk profile.</p>

<div id="module-goal-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Module Goal</h3>
<p>This module provides guidance for the development and management of <em>essential</em> documentation before, during, and at the close of a randomized clinical trial (RCT).</p>
</div>
<div id="general-considerations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> General Considerations</h3>
<p>Documentation provides validation that research is conducted maintaining the highest ethical and clinical standards as established by the World Health Organization and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for Clinical Good Practice (GCP)</p>
<p>Documentation requirements will vary according to several factors, such as intervention (e.g., drug, device, behavior), sponsor (e.g., NIH, drug company), and regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA). Thus, you should verify that your documentation plan complies with the specific your RCT.</p>
<p>The ICH GCP, section 8, “Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial” provides a full listing of documents that are generally deemed essential. These documents demonstrate that the trial conduct complies with the standards of GCP and all regulatory requirements. This module focuses on describing the following <strong>Essential Documents</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study Protocol</li>
<li>Manual of Operations</li>
<li>Statistical Analytic Protocol</li>
<li>Data Safety Monitoring Board Charter and Regular Reports (refer to other chapter for details)</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Protocol</h2>
<div id="what-6" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> What</h3>
<p>A study protocol describes the objective(s), design, methodology, statistical considerations, and organization of an RCT. It is the core document required for all parties who have responsibility for approval, conduct, oversight, and analysis of the RCT. Key sections typically include (also see template examples at the end of this module):</p>
<ul>
<li>Background/rationale</li>
<li>Objectives and purpose</li>
<li>Study design</li>
<li>Statement of qualifications</li>
<li>Criteria for inclusion, exclusion, and withdrawal of study subjects</li>
<li>Treatment /intervention</li>
<li>Methods and timing for assessing, recording and analyzing data</li>
<li>Methods for obtaining safety information and safety monitoring (Safety Monitoring Plan?)</li>
<li>Statistical methods</li>
<li>Ethical considerations</li>
<li>Statement related to permitting RCT-related monitoring, audits, and inspection by the sponsor, IEC/IRB, and regulators, including direct access to source data/documents (Site monitoring plan?)</li>
<li>Quality Control and Quality Assurance</li>
<li>Data handling and record keeping (Data Management Plan?)</li>
<li>Financing and Insurance</li>
<li>Informed consent procedures</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="why-6" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>The detailed rationale and approach to clinical research documented and maintained in the study protocol assures that the RCTs design and implementation adhere to the integrity of the science and ensure the validity of its findings. It is produced to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure feasibility of study design and objectives</li>
<li>Ensure that study design will result in the collection of crucial information</li>
<li>Clarify study requirements and methodology for all partners</li>
<li>Ensure approval of study by ethical committee(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Over-seeing regulatory bodies, such as Internal Review Board (IRB), Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), and National Institutes for Health (NIH) will request to review the study protocol for approval prior to starting the RCT, and may request the updated protocol at any point in the RCT. Top tier journals will also request access to the protocol prior to publication of the study’s findings.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-6" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> How</h3>
<p>The protocol must be completely written before the study begins. The initial draft often requires input from several team members, but the PI(s) should take responsibility for its final editing. It is a tedious but necessary process. Any changes to the study conduct (i.e., Protocol Amendments) must be meticulously documented and dated in a timely manner in the protocol and in clinical trials.com as required. The final protocol at the study’s end should reflect exactly what transpired during the study’s conduct. The Project Director can serve as the main organizer for maintaining the protocol and its updates under the PIs supervision.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Manual of Operational Procedures</h2>
<div id="what-7" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> What</h3>
<p>The Manual of Operational Procedures (MOP) is a handbook of instructions designed to guide the research team to successfully carry out all aspects of a particular research project according to that study’s research protocol. It clearly spells out the “who, what, where, when and how” of the RCT’s conduct. In general, the MOP transforms the protocol into a description of the exact procedures involved to implement every aspect of the RCT. Typically, each section of a MOP contains: steps required for task completion, person responsible, and resources required. Key sections typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Protocol (embedded in to MOP)</li>
<li>Study organization and responsibilities</li>
<li>Human Subjects Protection</li>
<li>Training plan</li>
<li>Communications plan</li>

<div id="why-7" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>The MOP is intended to serve as a study “cookbook”. The MOP facilitates adherence to study protocol, organizes the conduct of the study, and ensures consistency in research efforts throughout the study and across study sites. In theory, another investigator should be able to replicate the RCT’s conduct exactly as it was originally conducted by using the MOP.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-7" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> How</h3>
<p>The MOP must be completely written before the study begins. The initial draft requires input from several team members, particularly those closest to the research component being operationalized in each section. It is a tedious but necessary process. Any changes to the study procedures must be meticulously documented and dated in a timely manner in the MOP. The final MOP should reflect exactly what transpired during the study’s conduct. A project director can serve as the main organizer for maintaining the MOP and its updates under the PIs supervision. Copies of the MOP should be available at study sites and in the main study file system.</p>

<p>Interim data reports provide members of the DSMB with information to allow them to evaluate safety, study conduct, scientific validity and integrity of the trial. The reports convey data of relevant study activities and outcomes as agreed upon at the outset as in the purview of the DSMB. There are two types of the interim reports produced; one for the open session of the DSMB, and one for the closed session <em>(see Module XX).</em> . Sections generally included in these reports are listed below. Those marked by an asterisk are usually only included in the open report and not repeated in the closed reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report Summary</li>

<p>The open session report provides information on study conduct, including: recruitment and demographic data, subject/facility characteristics, protocol compliance, site performance, quality control, adverse event data, and outcome data when appropriate aggregated for both arms of the RCT (i.e.. all subjects).</p>
</div>
<div id="closed-session-report" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2.1.2</span> Closed Session Report</h5>
<p>The closed session report contains data similar to that presented in the open session report but is presented separately for each study arm in a semi-blinded fashion. For example, the arms are NOT identified by control or intervention, but as group 1 and group 2.

</div>
<div id="how-10" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2.3</span> How</h4>
<p>Prior to starting the study, the PI, and Statistician should work with the DSMB members and the Project Officer to draft a report outline using recommended guidelines or templates. Once approved by all parties, additions or modifications to these reports may be directed by the DSMB as the study progresses.</p>
<p>The research team prepares the data for the DSMB reports which should be sent to DSMB members 1 to 2 weeks prior to the meeting to allow sufficient time for review. There are software applications such as that can be automated to fill in the recurring data needed for these reports (see Data Management module).</p>
<p>The Closed Session Report is confidential. Printed copies of this report should be destroyed after the meeting. Procedures for securing and eliminating closed reports distributed to telephone and video conference participants should be specified in advance of the meeting.</p>

<div id="what-11" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> What</h3>
<p>The Regulatory Binder is an indexed collection of essential documents relevant to the RCT. While frequently referred to as a regulatory binder, it may also be called: Study Files, Investigator Files or Investigator Binder. ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (GCP) list documents generally considered essential for inclusion in the regulatory binder. The basic sections of a regulatory binder include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRB Information/Protocol Review Correspondence</li>
<li>Study Protocol and Supporting Documents</li>
<li>Informed Consent Forms and Supporting Documents</li>
<li>Source Documents</li>
<li>Case Report Forms (CRFs) / Data Collection Tools</li>
<li>Study Participant logs</li>
<li>Adverse Events &amp; Unanticipated Problems</li>
<li>Monitoring/Auditing</li>
<li>Correspondence and Meeting Minutes</li>
<li>Study-related SOPs/MOPs</li>
<li>Study Staff documentation (resume/CV and required certifications and conflict of interest)</li>
<li>Laboratory</li>
<li>Drug/Device Accountability</li>
<li>Regulatory Submissions</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="why-11" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>A complete regulatory binder allows ready access to all materials that reflect regulatory compliance and adherence to the ethical standards for Good Clinical Practice. The regulatory binder is often the first thing reviewed during audits and inspections.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-11" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.3</span> How</h3>
<p>The PI and Project Director (PD) should compile a list of all essential documents specific to the RCT as indicated by the sponsors and regulatory authorities. Many sponsors supply investigators with binders and organization strategies (see Resources). Additionally NIH provides a regulatory binder checklist.Harvard Catalyst provides a template for a regulatory binder (<a href="http://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/regbinder/" class="uri">http://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/regbinder/</a>).</p>
<p>The Project Director should be responsible for the creation and maintenance of the binder under the PI’s supervision. It is helpful to include a section in the MOP about the regulatory binder/file management addressing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation/required documents</li>
<li>Location of various components when study is on-going</li>
<li>Updating frequency and responsibility</li>
<li>Management/storage of outdated documents and retention requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>The regulatory binder may take the form of one or more physical binders, located in one or more physical locations. It may also take the form of an indexed collection of electronic documents maintained on a study website or shared file. Physical binders should be labeled (cover and spine) with the protocol number, PI name, and study site. Use multiple binders or master binders to maintain documentation as needed.</p>
<p>Access to the various sections of the binder may be controlled based on role in the study and status related to study blinding.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Data Sharing and Publication</h1>
<div id="introduction-2" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Research dissemination can be defined as follows: “A planned process that involves consideration of target audiences and the settings in which research findings are to be received and, where appropriate, communicating and interacting with wider policy and health service audiences in ways that will facilitate research uptake in decision- making processes and practice”. <em>Wilson et al, Implementation Science 2010, 5:91</em></p>
<p>Traditionally, research dissemination centers on the publication of results in peer reviewed journals and academic conference presentations. Recent initiatives seek to broaden the concept of research dissemination such that the main messages from results are communicated to targeted decision-makers and stakeholders in a way that encourages them to factor the research implications into their work and clinical practice. This module will focus on two aspects of dissemination particularly relevant to Clinical Trials: 1. Data sharing and 2. Publication in scientific journals</p>
<p>Regardless of the scope, researchers are encouraged to <em>develop a dissemination plan early in the course of all trials.</em> Trials that are closer to later phases of research translation (i.e., implementation) and those supported by certain agencies (e.g., Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)) may require more robust dissemination plans in grant applications that go beyond traditional journal publications and meeting presentations.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Data Sharing</h2>
<div id="what-12" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> What</h3>
<p>To maximize transparency and investment, policymakers seek to expand public and investigator access to clinical trial data. The extent of data sharing can range from sharing aggregated data describing subject characteristics and outcomes, to providing de-identified patient-level data. Data sharing requirements depend on evolving policies of funding agencies (i.e., NIH) and other regulators. <em>Researchers are strongly encouraged to consult the most up-to-date requirements as early as possible in planning of their clinical trial (see section 2.3 below).</em></p>
</div>
<div id="why-12" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Why</h3>
<p>The intent of data sharing is to maximize the transparency and benefits of research. Moreover, some level of data sharing for clinical trials is often required by regulatory authorities, funding agencies and the ICMJE.</p>
<p>When done appropriately, data sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increases public trust by increasing transparency of research efforts</li>
<li>Maximizes the public health impact of research</li>
<li>Encourages scientific inquiry and new research efforts</li>
<li>Encourages diversity of analysis and opinion</li>
<li>Permits the creation of new datasets when data from multiple sources are combined</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="how-12" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> How</h3>
<p>In September 2016 the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a new regulation and the NIH has issued a new policy to increase the availability of information about clinical trials.  The HHS <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/21/2016-22129/clinical-trials-registration-and-results-information-submission">Final Rule</a> describes requirements for registering and submitting summary results information for certain clinical trials to <a href="file:///C:\Users\elainebergman\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary%20Internet%20Files\Content.Outlook\SJPDZYVY\ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>.  A complimentary <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/21/2016-22379/dissemination-of-nih-funded-clinical-trial-information">NIH policy</a> that applies to all clinical trials funded by NIH, regardless of whether they are subject to the Final Rule was also published today. The Final NIH Policy was also published in the <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-149.html">NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts</a>.</p>
<p>NIH has made available the following resources to help explain these changes. </p>

<div id="methods-for-data-sharing" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3.1</span> Methods for Data Sharing</h4>
<p>There are numerous approaches to data sharing, each of which has different levels of privacy protection and mechanisms for sharing. Researchers can manage requests for data personally on an individual request basis, or through use of a secure data archive or enclave. Investigators should select a mode of data sharing that is appropriate based on the size, complexity and sensitivity of the data, as well as the volume of data use requests anticipated. See the <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_guidance.htm#methods">NIH data sharing guidance</a> for details.</p>
<p>The NIH provides numerous <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_repositories.html">data sharing repositories</a> which make data accessible for reuse. If you are doing an NIH funded trial, consult your Project Officer to discuss options for sharing data.</p>
<p>IFAR has created several sensitive data policies (including data access, encryption, sharing, security, suppression, retention and destruction, etc.) please see these policies on the <a href="http://thehslhub/Departments/Roslindale/HSL-IFAR/Administration/Policies-and-Forms">HSL HUB policy and forms</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="human-subjects-and-privacy-issues" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3.2</span> Human Subjects and Privacy Issues</h4>
<p>All data sharing activities must be compliant with HIPAA, local, state and organizational regulations. All compliances and restrictions should be addressed in the data sharing plan section of the funding application. There are two basic approaches to protecting sensitive data: restricting information in the shared dataset, and restricting access to the data. See <a href="file:///\hebrewseniorlife.local\home\research-users\ElaineBergman\ISAC\Data%20Sharing%20Publication%20and%20dissemination">NIH data sharing guidance</a> (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_guidance.htm#methods" class="uri">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_guidance.htm#methods</a>) for details.</p>
<p>The plan for data sharing may include stripping a dataset of all potential participant identifiers. Depending on the data and study population, the level of information that will need to be removed from the database varies. Studies involving participants with unusual characteristics (Samples drawn from small geographic areas, rare populations, and linked datasets) will likely involve a greater degree of anonymizing to ensure the privacy of study participants.</p>
<p>Data archives and enclaves can be set up to restrict access at any level. Data Use Agreements restrict the use of data to those specifically identified in the agreement, and require that data be used only for research purposes.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="http://thehslhub/Departments/Roslindale/HSL-IFAR/Administration/Policies-and-Forms">IFAR policy on Limited Data Sets and Data Use agreements</a> on the HSL HUB as well as the <a href="http://thehslhub/Forms/Documents-and-Forms/IFAR/IFAR-IRB-SOP">HSL IRB SOPs on HIPAA and the use of data in research</a>.</p>

<div id="general-considerations-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> General Considerations</h3>
<p>All paper and abstracts emanating from your trial should be planned early on in the study to maximize the productivity from the trial and avoid iterative papers. In planning, it is useful to outline the topic of paper, target journal and responsible first author.</p>
<p>Larger trials should have a <em>Publications Steering Committee</em> whose members are usually the lead investigators and establish written guidelines for vetting papers emanating from the trial. This procedure for planning, reviewing and approving all scientific publications (papers and abstracts) prior to submission to ensure they are accurate (i.e., align with protocol), not duplicative, and respect ICMJE authorship guidelines. Certain funding agencies and industry sponsors trials may have very specific requirements regarding their own review and approval of manuscripts prior to submission.</p>
<p>Section III of the <a href="https://www.acrin.org/RESEARCHERS/POLICIES/PUBLICATIONSPOLICY/PUBLICATIONSPOLICYDOCUMENT.aspx">ACRIN publication policy</a> provides details related to the roles and responsibilities of publication committees.</p>
</div>
<div id="specific-reporting-guidelines-for-clinical-trials" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Specific Reporting Guidelines for Clinical Trials</h3>
<p>Clinical trials reporting has specific standard guidelines that differ by the type of trial design and which are continually being updated. For example, there are set standards for the flow diagrams presenting subject participation in a clinical trial that differ between traditional parallel design randomized trials, non-inferiority trials, cluster randomized trials, stepped wedge designs etc. Journals generally follow the guidelines described in the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/"><strong>CONSORT</strong> (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.equator-network.org/">EQUATOR</a> (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) is also a very useful comprehensible searchable website with up-to-date links the CONSORT statements and extensions.</p>

<div id="what-13" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.1</span> What</h4>
<p>Protocol manuscripts report the methodology of your clinical trial. Details in a published protocol paper (e.g., primary and secondary outcome definitions, sample size estimates) need to align with other official communications describing the study’s methodology such as the trial protocol and descriptions in ClinicalTrials.gov. These documents may be compared by journals considering publication of the trial’s results and discrepancies will need to be explained.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-13" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.2</span> Why</h4>
<p>Reasons to publish a protocol paper include increasing transparency of the trial conduct, providing a detailed reference for future publications emanating from the study, and demonstrating productivity for funding agencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-13" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.3</span> How</h4>
<p>Planning for a protocol manuscript submission should begin early because journals generally only consider publishing protocol papers for studies that have received ethics approval but have not yet concluded patient recruitment.</p>
</div>
<div id="selecting-a-journal" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.4</span> Selecting a Journal</h4>
<p>Examples of journals that publish protocol papers include: Clinical Trials: Journal of the Society of Clinical Trials, Contemporary Clinical Trials, International Journal of Clinical Trials, Journal of Clinical Trials, BMJ, and Trials. Some of these journal allow authors to pay for publication of their protocol paper (e.g., Journal of Clinical Trials) and others have the option of paying for open access should the paper be accepted.</p>
<p>In deciding which journal is the most appropriate to publish your protocol, it is useful to first review prior protocol papers published in specific journals to see which best aligns with your study and examine their formats. All journals will have specific guidelines for preparation which should be carefully consulted and adhered to.</p>

<div id="timing" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4.1</span> Timing</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/results/reporting/en/">WHO Statement on Public Disclosure of Clinical Trial Results</a> states, at a minimum, main findings of clinical trials, positive or negative, are to be submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal within 12 months of study completion and are to be published through an open access mechanism unless there is a specific reason why open access cannot be used, or otherwise made available publicly at most within 24 months of study completion.</p>
</div>
<div id="trial-registration-identification" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4.2</span> Trial Registration Identification</h4>
<p>As per the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/preparing-for-submission.html">ICMJE guidelines</a>, top-tier journals require that your trial be registered on <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> (<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" class="uri">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a>) (or equivalent such as <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html">WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)</a>) prior to the enrollment of the first subject, otherwise the paper will be rejected without review. The trial registration number must be included in your manuscript and usually appears at the end of the abstract.</p>
<p>The ICMJE encourages posting of clinical trial results in clinical trial registries. The ICMJE will not consider as prior publication the posting of trial results in any registry that meets the above criteria if results are limited to a brief (500 word) structured abstract or tables (to include patients enrolled, key outcomes, and adverse events).</p>
</div>
<div id="packaging-results" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4.3</span> Packaging results</h4>
<p>Investigators are cautioned to carefully plan the paper (s) emanating from a single trial to avoid iterative publications, ensure the main trial results are not usurped by early papers, and to adhere with the pre-specified analyses set forth in the trial protocol and as described on ClinicalTrials.gov. One should reserve the main paper to include the pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes. <em>“Outcome switching” (i.e., changing the outcomes reported in results paper with those pre-specified in the protocol and on ClinicalTrials.gov) must be avoided.</em></p>
<p>Following publication of the main paper, non-iterative auxiliary papers that leverage the rich clinical trials data may be considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="manuscript-preparation" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4.4</span> Manuscript Preparation</h4>
<p>All manuscripts should adhere to the guidelines provided in each journals’ Instructions for Authors which generally follow <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/preparing-for-submission.html">ICMJE guidelines</a> (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/preparing-for-submission.html" class="uri">http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/preparing-for-submission.html</a>)</p>
<p>Most journals which have a specific reporting criteria for clinical trials results manuscripts which generally follow the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT statement</a> (<a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/" class="uri">http://www.consort-statement.org/</a>). CONSORT provides an extremely useful <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/checklists/view/32-consort/66-title">checklist</a> (<a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/checklists/view/32-consort/66-title" class="uri">http://www.consort-statement.org/checklists/view/32-consort/66-title</a>) to help guide presentation of every element of a clinical trial manuscript and is a <strong><em>highly recommended resource.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div id="adjunct-material" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4.5</span> Adjunct material</h4>
<p>Most top tier journals will request a copy of the trial protocol with the submission of the paper describing the clinical trial results.
