<h2 id="purpose-of-toolkit">Purpose of toolkit</h2>

<p>This toolkit is a <em>general</em> guide for investigators and project staff at
Hebrew SeniorLife Institute for Aging Research (HSL IFAR) conducting,
managing or overseeing clinical trials in older populations. The toolkit
is not intended be a comprehensive document. Rather it is meant to
outline major considerations for all phases of a clinical trial.
Suggested resources are provided for more detailed information <strong>and you
must consult and adhere to the latest federal, sponsor, institutional,
state and regional regulations.</strong></p>

<p>Whenever possible, sections of this toolkit follow a similar outline:
What, Why, How, Special Considerations for Aging Populations, Common
Pitfalls, and Resources.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-are-doing-a-clinical-trial">Are you are doing a clinical trial?</h2>

<p>Below is the National Institutes of Health (NIH) definition of a
clinical trial. As clinical trials are subject to additional oversight,
a clear definition helps investigators ensure that they are meeting all
of their obligations, and help funders ensure that the additional
oversight is occurring when it is needed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A research study^1 ^in which one or more human subjects^2^ are
prospectively assigned^3^ to one or more interventions^4^ (which may
include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those
interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.^5^</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>^1^See Common Rule definition of *research</em> at 45 CFR 46.102(d).*</p>

<p><em>^2^See Common Rule definition of *human subject</em> at 45 CFR 46.102(f).*</p>

<p><em>^3^“Prospectively assigned” refers to a pre-defined process (e.g., randomization) specified in a protocol that stipulates the assignment of research subjects (individually or in clusters) to one or more arms of a clinical trial.</em></p>

<p><em>^4^An intervention is defined as a manipulation of the subject or subject’s environment for the purpose of modifying one or more health-related biomedical or behavioral processes and/or endpoints.  Examples include:  drugs/small molecules/compounds; biologics; devices; procedures (e.g., surgical techniques); delivery systems (e.g., telemedicine); strategies to change health-related behavior (e.g., diet, cognitive therapy, exercise); treatment strategies; prevention strategies; and, diagnostic strategies.</em></p>

<p><em>^5^Health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome is defined as the pre-specified goal(s) or condition(s) that reflect the effect of one or more interventions on human subjects’ biomedical or behavioral status or quality of life.  Examples include:  positive or negative changes to physiological or biological parameters (e.g., improvement of lung capacity); positive or negative changes to psychological or neurodevelopmental parameters (e.g., mood management intervention for smokers; reading comprehension and /or information retention); positive or negative changes to disease processes; positive or negative changes to health-related behaviors; and, positive or negative changes to quality of life.</em></p>

<h2 id="clinical-trial-phases">Clinical Trial Phases</h2>

<p>Clinical trials are conducted in a series of steps, called phases - each
phase is designed to answer a separate research question. These phases
mostly apply to trials testing drugs or devices, rather than behavioral
interventions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Phase I:</strong> Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small
group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety,
determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Phase II:</strong> The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of
people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate
its safety.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Phase III:</strong> The drug or treatment is given to large groups of
people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare
it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will
allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Phase IV:</strong> Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been
marketed to gather information on the drug’s/treatment’s effect in
various populations and any side effects associated with
long-term use.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="training-requirements-and-opportunities">Training requirements and opportunities:</h2>
<p>Aside from clinical trial design and/or biostatistical training, there are varied practical,
short-term courses for principal investigators and project personnel to
enhance the conduct and rigor of their clinical trials.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Good Clinical Practice</strong> (<strong>GCP</strong>) is an international quality
standard that defines standards for clinical trials involving
human subjects. <strong>The NIH require C</strong><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-148.html#_ftn2"><strong>ertifications in Good
Clinical
Practice</strong></a>
<strong>for NIH-funded Investigators and clinical trial site staff who are
responsible for the conduct, management and oversight of NIH-funded

<h1 id="human-subject-protection-and-research-regulation">Human Subject Protection and Research Regulation</h1>

<h2 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>### Module Goal
The goal for this module is to introduce the essential elements of human
subjects’ protections and regulatory requirements pertinent to the
conduct of clinical trials. Essential aspects of human subjects’
protections and regulatory requirements provided in this module include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Institutional Review Boards</li>
  <li>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</li>
  <li>Data Use Agreements</li>
  <li>ClinicalTrials Registration</li>
  <li>Data Safety Monitoring</li>
  <li>Informed Consent</li>
  <li>Adverse event monitoring and reporting</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="general-considerations-about-federal-regulations">General Considerations about federal regulations</h3>

<p>The regulation of clinical trials can be complex. What may be seen by
investigators as trivial regulations or minor misdemeanors can have
serious consequences for the individual investigator, their
institutions, sponsors, and trial subjects. Therefore, it is wise to be
over-cautious and anticipate problems before they arise. <strong>As regulatory
issues can play a critical role in your trial design, it is strongly
advised to consider these issues from the very start of project planning
(e.g. grant preparation) by consulting with your institutional review
board (IRB), and making sure you understand existing regulations and
institutional policies</strong>.</p>

<p>Federal agencies including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS (includes National
Institutes of Health (NIH)), make and enforce regulations to ensure the
safety of participants in clinical trials, and retain final authority
for determining whether an institution has been compliant.
<strong>Investigators should review the specific regulations of the funding or
over-seeing agency and confer with the IRB to determine whether
additional regulations or policies apply. The investigator must keep in
mind that when more than one regulation, guidance, or policy applies the
most stringent must be followed.</strong></p>

<p><em>HHS regulated trials (includes NIH):</em> HHS requirements for federally
funded human subjects’ research is codified in 45 CFR Part 46
“Protection of Human Subjects”
(<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/</a>).
This set of regulations are based on the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/">Belmont
Report</a></p>

<p><em>FDA Regulated Trials:</em> The FDA has their own set of human subject
regulations and regulations CFR – Code of Federal Regulations Title 21
governing IRB activities, which goes beyond the scope of this module. A
key initial step is to determine whether or not your trial falls under
the regulatory jurisdiction of the FDA which generally oversees drug and
device trials. For more information check <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/ucm155713.htm">FDA
regulations</a>.</p>

<p><em>Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP):</em> The OHRP is the federal
body responsible for compliance monitoring. Under Title IV of the Public
Health Service Act (42 USC 281 et seq.), OHRP has the authority to
investigate complaints about human subject protections in HHS-funded
research, or other research covered by the institution’s Assurance of
Compliance. For general regulatory issues, particularly for federally
funded trials, refer to the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/">OHRP website</a>.</p>

<p><em>International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice
(GCP):</em> While federal regulations provide the standards by which human
subjects research is to be conducted, guidance documents and
institutional policies add specificity and provide direction on how to
apply regulatory requirements. One such guidance is the ICH GCP guidance
Compliance with the ICH GCP assures that the rights and well-being of
trial subjects are protected and that the clinical trial data are
credible.

<h2 id="institutional-review-board-irb">Institutional Review Board (IRB)</h2>
<p>### What</p>

<p>An institutional review board (IRB) is an appropriately constituted
group formally designated to review, approve and monitor research
involving human subjects to ensure it is conducted in accordance with
applicable federal regulations, institutional policies, and ethical
guidelines.</p>

<p>While all IRBs are responsible to adhere to the same regulations as
defined by <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy">OHRP</a>,
(http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy.), each IRB is required
to have its own institutional policies and operates differently. It is
critical to understand the requirements of the IRB overseeing your
project. Specific information relevant to HSL IRB can be found on the
IRB section of the <a href="http://www.instituteforagingresearch.org/resources/research-administration/institutional-review-board">HSL
website</a>
(<a href="http://www.instituteforagingresearch.org/resources/research-administration/institutional-review-board">http://www.instituteforagingresearch.org/resources/research-administration/institutional-review-board</a>)
as well as the: <a href="http://thehslhub/Departments/Roslindale/HSL-IFAR/Institutional-Review-Board">internal HSL
“HUB”</a>
(<a href="http://thehslhub/Departments/Roslindale/HSL-IFAR/Institutional-Review-Board">http://thehslhub/Departments/Roslindale/HSL-IFAR/Institutional-Review-Board</a>).</p>

<h4 id="categories-of-irb-oversight">Categories of IRB oversight</h4>

<p>Depending on the study design and degree to which human subjects are
involved, the IRB will review the research and will make a determination
on the appropriate review level. The basic levels of review include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exempt (determination by IRB Chair or her designee)</li>
  <li>Expedited (review/approval by IRB Chair or her designee)</li>
</ul>

<p>Full Board (review/approval by the convened IRB) Most clinical trials
will require full IRB review.</p>

<h4 id="irb-applications-and-reviews">IRB Applications and Reviews</h4>

<p>IRB applications include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initial application</li>
  <li>Annual/continuing review</li>
  <li>Amendments/modifications to the protocol or study materials</li>
  <li>Incident Reports for:
    <ul>
      <li>Unanticipated problems</li>
      <li>Non-Compliance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="initial-review-of-research-application">Initial Review of Research Application</h5>

<p>All human subjects’ research must be reviewed and approved by an IRB
before human subjects activities can begin. This includes recruitment
efforts, and receiving or collecting data. Per Federal and Institutional
policy, no funds for research involving human subjects activities will
be released until the appropriate IRB approval has been secured.</p>

<h5 id="annualcontinuing-review">Annual/Continuing Review</h5>

<p>Investigators must receive continuing approval of their research at
least annually. On some occasions, more frequent review may be required
by the IRB. Continuing approval is required until all activities with
human subjects are complete (this includes access to data with
participant identifiers or with codes that can be linked back to
research participants).</p>

<h5 id="amendment-submissions">Amendment Submissions</h5>

<p>Investigators must submit all changes to the research or research
materials and receive IRB approval for those changes prior to
implementation (except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate
hazards to research participants).</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>The IRB assures that a clinical trial is in compliance with federal and
state regulations, institutional policies, and accepted ethical
guidelines, to protect the rights and welfare of research subjects.</p>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>

<h4 id="irb-review-for-single-site-trials">IRB Review for Single Site Trials</h4>

<p>The procedures for IRB review differ by institution but have common main
elements. It is wise before you embark on your IRB application to
consult with the IRB office to review the general study design and
anticipate key review considerations.</p>

<p>The HSL IFAR IRB uses an electronic submissions system (Cayuse). Forms
are templated and will guide you through the required elements.
Application submissions must meet deadlines stipulated in the <a href="http://thehslhub/~/media/HSLNet/Docs/IFAR/IRB/IRB_SOP.ashx">HSL IFAR
IRB Standard Operating
Procedures</a>.</p>

<h4 id="irb-review-for-multi-site-trials">IRB Review for Multi-Site Trials</h4>

<p>Many clinical trials involve multiple sites and/or investigators from
multiple institutions. Many clinical trials involve multiple sites that
are clearly engaged in human subjects’ research (i.e., site personnel
are recruiting subjects, implementing an intervention, or collecting
data). Regulatory oversight of these trials can be done either by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single IRB review (one IRB reviews the research, and the other IRBs
rely on the reviewing IRB)</li>
  <li>Multiple IRB reviews (e.g. each institution conducts its own
IRB review/approval)</li>
</ul>

<p>In June 2016, the NIH established a
<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-094.html">policy</a>
effective May 25, 2017, requiring a single IRB for all NIH-funded
multisite studies, with only rare exceptions.</p>

<p>IRBs of engaged sites and investigators may cede oversight
responsibility to the IRB reviewing the research (also referred to as
the IRB of record). Relying on an external IRB, or ceded review, is
documented with a formal agreement between the reviewing and relying
site IRBs and must be signed by an Institutional Official. Note: If you
are conducting research with Harvard affiliates, you may rely on the
Harvard Catalyst Reliance Agreement, rather than an IRB Authorization
Agreement. See the HSL IRB office for more information.</p>

<p>Some study sites engaging in human subjects’ research (e.g., community
nursing homes) may not be associated with an IRB. In this case the
reviewing IRB may agree to provide IRB oversight for the external site
through a formalized agreement (Individual Investigator Agreement)
between the two parties. Alternatively, a commercial IRB may be engaged
in a contract to provide oversight for that external site. Sites that
receive direct federal awards for research purposes may also need a
<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/fwas/fwa-protection-of-human-subjecct/index.html">FederalWide
Assurances</a>.
These determinations will be made by the prime IRB responsible for the
trial.</p>

<h3 id="special-considerations-for-older-subjects">Special considerations for older subjects</h3>

<p>There are two special considerations for special protections governing
research with elderly subjects: cognitive impairment and
institutionalization. Under those conditions, a number of issues must be
taken into consideration. See <a href="http://archive.hhs.gov/ohrp/irb/irb_chapter6.htm">OHRPs related
guidance</a> and <a href="http://thehslhub/~/media/HSLNet/Docs/IFAR/IRB/IRB_SOP.ashx">HSL IRB’s
Standard Operating Procedures
(SOPs)</a>. <em>See
also Informed Consent Section related to the decision making capacity
section 7.4)</em>:</p>

<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Not seeking IRB guidance in the process of trial design and well in
advance of your planned start date.</li>
  <li>Underestimating the time it takes to get IRB approval.</li>
  <li>Underestimating regulatory requirements. Failure to meet
requirements could lead to serious consequences for yourself and
your institution. Be overly cautious and always report anything of
potential concern to your IRB.</li>
  <li>Flippant or casual comments about human subjects’ or regulatory
issues about your trial via emails or text. If a problem occurs, all
related communication may be become eventually become relevant.</li>

<h2 id="the-health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-hipaa">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</h2>
<p>### What 
The HIPAA, enacted through the Privacy Rule, establishes national
standards for the protection of protected health information (PHI). The
rule establishes conditions under which PHI may be used by covered
entities^1^, including for research^2^ purposes. With regards to
research, the Privacy Rule also defines the means by which individuals
should be informed of uses of their medical information for research
purposes, and their rights to access information about them held by
covered entities.</p>

<p>^1^<em><strong>Covered entities</strong>: health plans, health care clearinghouses and
health care providers who transmit any health information in connection
with transactions for which HHS has adopted standards.</em></p>

<p>^2^<strong>*Research</strong>: Defined in the Privacy Rule “a systematic
investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation,
designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” *</p>

<h3 id="why-1">Why</h3>

<p>The Privacy Rule protects the privacy of individually identifiable
health information, while at the same time ensuring that researchers
have access to medical information necessary to conduct vital research.</p>

<h3 id="how-1">How</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/">Privacy Rule</a> builds upon the
protections provided to human subjects in the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/common-rule/">Common Rule (45 CFR Part
46, Subpart
A)</a>, and/or the <a href="http://osp.od.nih.gov/office-clinical-research-and-bioethics-policy/clinical-research-policy/research-involving-human-subjects">Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) human subject
protection regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and
56)</a>.
There are three main areas for researchers to consider:</p>

<h4 id="screening-patients-for-recruitment">Screening patients for recruitment</h4>

<p>Selection of subjects for a clinical trial often requires identifying
patients with specific characteristics (e.g., a diagnosis) from a large
patient population using data considered PHI. To facilitate such
efforts, covered entities are permitted to use and disclose PHI for
research purposes pursuant to a waiver of authorization by an IRB or
Privacy Board. At HSL, the IRB also serves as the Privacy Board</p>

<h4 id="inclusion-of-hipaa-assurances-in-informed-consent-forms">Inclusion of HIPAA assurances in informed consent forms</h4>

<p>When PHI is being used in a research study, the consent form must
include core elements and essential language for authorization of use of
PHI as defined by the Privacy Rule (see Privacy Rule, 45
C.F.R. §164.508(c)(1)). At HSL, the required language is included in the
Informed Consent Template available in the online IRB application system
Cayuse. <strong>Investigators should not alter these templates without
consulting the IRB.</strong></p>

<h4 id="handling-of-phi-throughout-the-trial">Handling of PHI throughout the trial</h4>

<p>A core tenant of HIPAA and the use of PHI is to use the minimum
necessary information in order to maintain and protect patient privacy.
As such, clinical trials must be designed and conducted to minimize
unnecessary data collection and maximize subject confidentiality.
Whenever possible, information obtained from patients or their medical
records should be collected without identifiers. When identifiable data
is collected, the protocol must be designed to maintain confidentiality
of identifiable data, and data security measures appropriate to the
degree of risk from disclosure.</p>

<p>A complete summary of key elements of the Privacy Rule including who is
covered, what information is protected, and how PHI can be used and
disclosed is presented in the “<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html">Summary of the HIPAA Privacy
Rule</a>.

Privacy Rule between a HIPAA covered entity (e.g., HSL) and a third
party who wishes to obtain PHI with limited identifiers, referred to as
a Limited Data Set (LDS). DUAs address issues such as limitations on use
of the data, obligations to safeguard the data, liability for harm
arising from the use of the data, publication, and privacy rights that
are associated with transfers of confidential or protected data. Refer
to <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/eplc/EPLC%20Archive%20Documents/55-Data%20Use%20Agreement%20(DUA)/eplc_dua_practices_guide.pdf">HIPAA, Section 45 CFR part 160 Subparts A and E of Part
164</a>
for details. A common example of a study that requires a DUA, is one
that utilizes Medicare data for which a DUA must be set up with the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. See resources below for guidance.</p>

<h3 id="why-2">Why</h3>
<p>In addition to the requirements set forth in the Privacy Rule, a DUA
clearly establishes the rules and expectations related to provision and
use of data by the involved parties (provider and recipient). DUA must
be entered into <em>before</em> there is any use or disclosure of a limited
data set to an outside institution or party.</p>

<h3 id="how-2">How</h3>
<p>The content, format, and processes of establishing DUAs differ depending
on the entities involved. Investigators must use approved DUA frameworks
at these entities and their institutions. <a href="http://thehslhub/~/media/HSLNet/P_P/IFAR/IFARPPCMS.ashx">HSL IFAR policies related to
DUAs</a> can be
found on the HUB.</p>

<h2 id="clinical-trial-registration">CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION</h2>
<p>### What
ClinicalTrials.gov is an on-line public registry of clinical trials
maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National
Library of Medicine. It was launched in 2000 and expanded by the Federal
Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA 801) in 2007 and is endorsed by
the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).</p>

<h4 id="which-trials-must-be-registered">Which Trials Must be Registered?</h4>

<p>It is strongly recommended that ALL clinical trials are registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov. By law, only trials that meet the FDAAA 801
definition of an “applicable clinical trial” must be registered which
generally include interventional studies (with one or more arms) of
FDA-regulated drugs, biological products, or devices. However, in 2014,
the NIH proposed expanding clinicaltrials.gov registration requirements
to include all NIH-funded clinical trials. Thus, even clinical trials in
which the intervention is a behavior modification or clinical education
program merits registration on ClinicalTrials.org<strong>. It is strongly
recommended that ALL clinical trials are registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov.</strong></p>

<h3 id="why-3">Why</h3>
<p>There are numerous <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/background">reasons for registering a
trial</a>. Refer to
Clinicaltrials.gov for elaboration.</p>

<h4 id="required-by-law">Required by Law</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-110publ85/pdf/PLAW-110publ85.pdf#page=82">Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA
801)</a>
requires Responsible Parties to register and submit summary results of
clinical trials with ClinicalTrials.gov. The law applies to certain
clinical trials of drugs (including biological products) and medical
devices.</p>

<h4 id="required-for-journal-publication">Required for Journal Publication</h4>
<p>The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/publishing-and-editorial-issues/clinical-trial-registration.html">requires
trial registration</a>
as a condition of the publication of research results generated by a
clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov is a registry where organizations and
individuals can provide the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/trds/en/index.html">Trial
Registration Data
Set</a> required by
ICMJE. Top tier journals will scrutinize the registration of your trial
on ClinicalTrials.gov and make sure that is aligns with the description
provided in your paper. <strong>Most journals have a strict requirement that
your trial be registered no more within 21 days after enrollment of the
first participant and will reject your paper it is this is not the
case.</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-3">How</h3>

<p>Trial registry is done on the ClinicalTrials.gov. Protocol Registration
and Results System (PRS). The PI (and in some circumstances, a lead
person on the study team) should be assigned as the Responsible Party
charged with initiating and maintaining the registration. Once submitted
by the PI, institutional administrators (the HSL IRB Director at IFAR)
are notified of the submission and must verify the information in the
registration (including changes and updates to the study) and approve
and release it before it is sent to administrators at ClinicalTrials.gov
for review and eventual posting.</p>

<h4 id="initial-submission">Initial submission</h4>

<p>The clinical trial must be registered no later than 21 days after
enrollment of the first participant. Note this rule is strictly enforced
by major journals. If initial registration is not done within this
timeframe, the trial results will be disqualified from consideration for
publication. The application and direction are online at
<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/how-apply">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/how-apply</a>.</p>

<h4 id="registration-updates">Registration Updates</h4>

<p>Responsible Parties should update their records within 30 days of a
change to any of the following:</p>

<h2 id="data-safety-monitoring">DATA SAFETY MONITORING</h2>
<p>### What
Funding agencies require that the safety of trial participants and
integrity of data are ensured through systems of research oversight and
monitoring. The type and level of monitoring required depends on the
risk, nature, size and complexity of the clinical trial. It can be as
simple as basic monitoring by the PI, an independent safety officer or
medical monitor, or an NIH officer, or as complex as a full independent
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). <strong>The decision about the level of
data safety monitoring required for your study is ordinarily determined
by the sponsor (i.e., NIH), but it may also be required by the IRB.</strong>
The remainder of this module assumes your trial requires full DSMB.</p>

<p>The DSMB is a formally appointed independent group, consisting of at
least three (3) voting members external to the research that typically
include experts in the relevant field of study, statistics, and study
design. The clinical trial PI(s) and lead statistician also typically
participate as internal members on the DSMB.</p>

<p>The DSMB conducts interim monitoring of accumulating data from research
activities to assure the continuing safety of human subjects, relevance
of the study question, appropriateness of the study, and integrity of
the accumulating data.</p>

<h3 id="why-4">Why</h3>
<p>The purpose of a DSMB is to ensure the safety of human subjects,
relevance of the study question, appropriateness of the study, and
integrity of the accumulating data. Additionally, the DSMB attempts to
identify threats to credibility or the validity of the study related to
slow rates of accrual, high rates of ineligibility after randomization,
high rates of protocol violations, and unexpectedly high dropout rates.</p>

<p>The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Periodic review and evaluation of the accumulated study data for
participant safety, study conduct and progress, and, when
appropriate, efficacy.</li>
  <li>Provision of written documentation confirming review of the protocol
and agreement with the study design and the data safety monitoring
plan (DSMP).</li>
  <li>Make recommendations to study sponsor concerning the continuation,
modification, unmasking or termination of the trial.</li>
  <li>Provide a written report to the IRB which summarizes oversight
activities and recommendations, and any concerns regarding
subject safety.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-4">How</h3>
<p>There are four basic steps in establishing a trial’s Data Safety Monitoring system:</p>

<h4 id="establish-a-data-safety-monitoring-plan-dsmp">Establish a Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)</h4>

<p>The PI should create a Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) that is
appropriate for the type and expected risks of the research. The DSMP
must be included with the protocol in the initial submission to the IRB.
<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/data-and-safety-monitorin">Templates of
DSMPs</a>
are available on the NIH website<em>. DSMPs</em> generally include the
following elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data or events to be captured under the monitoring provisions (e.g.,
unanticipated problems and adverse events)</li>
  <li>The entity responsible (e.g., investigators, sponsor, a coordinating
or statistical center, an independent monitor, DSMB) for monitoring
the data collected and the time frames for reporting</li>
  <li>The frequency of assessments of data or events captured by the
monitoring provisions</li>
  <li>Definition of specific triggers or stopping rules that dictate when
action is required</li>
  <li>Procedures for communicating to the IRB(s), the study sponsor, the
investigator(s), and other appropriate officials the outcome of the
reviews by the monitoring entity.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="establish-the-dsmb-membership">Establish the DSMB membership</h4>
<p>For NIH-funded studies, the Program Official (PO) holds primary
responsibility for the formation of the DSMB and selecting the external
members unless otherwise specified in the Terms of Award. External DSMB
members should not have direct involvement in the conduct of the study
or any financial, proprietary, professional, or other interests that may
affect their impartiality. Study investigators should have opportunity
to review the proposed members before the candidate’s interest and
availability are confirmed.</p>

<p>Once the group has been formed, the PO will select the DSMB Chair. All
external DSMB must sign a Conflict of Interest certification that should
be kept in the Essential Documents binder. Each IRB should be informed
of the membership and operating procedures.</p>

<h4 id="create-dsmb-charter">Create DSMB Charter</h4>
<p>Before the trial begins a DSMB charter must be prepared that details the
roles and responsibilities of the DSMB. The charter is usually drafted
by the PO and subject to approval by PIs and DSMB members (see section
5.1 in Essential Documents that details the contents of the DSMB
Charter) (link). The DSMB Charter should be maintained in the Essential
Documents binder.</p>

<h4 id="create-dsmb-report-templates-and-meeting-documentation">Create DSMB Report Templates and Meeting Documentation</h4>
<p>The next step is for the research team to work with the DSMB members to
create templates for the Open and Closed Sessions of the DSMB meetings.
Templates for these reports are described in section 5.2 of the
Essential Documents section [add link]. Finally, a system to maintain
agendas and minutes from the DSMB meetings should be established. All
DSMB reports, agendas and minutes must be maintained in the Essential
Documents binder.</p>

<h4 id="establish-meeting-schedule-and-structure">Establish Meeting Schedule and Structure</h4>
<p><em>Prior to the start of the trial</em>, the DSMB should convene as many times
as needed to review the protocol and approve all data safety monitoring
protocols, templates of essential documents, and processes for
conducting the business of the DSMB (e.g., schedule, voting rules,
minutes, definition of a quorum).</p>

<p>Unless otherwise determined, the PO is responsible for convening
meetings, and coordinating the distribution of materials to DSMB members
and other meeting participants prior to the meeting. The agenda for each
meeting is generally developed jointly by the PO, the PI (s) (regardless
of whether a contract, cooperative agreement, or grant), the study
statistician, and DSMB Chair. These details of these responsibilities
should be agreed upon by the PO and PI (s).</p>

<p>Once a study has started, most DSMBs meet every 6 months, but at least
annually. Additional DSMB meetings may be requested by DSMB members, the
PO, collaborators, IRB, or PI at any time and up to the discretion of
the PO and DSMB Chair.</p>

<p>Meetings may be held by telephone, videoconferences or in-person In the
event a DSMB member cannot attend a meeting, he/she may receive a copy
of the closed session DSMB report (see below) and either participate by
conference call or provide written comments to the DSMB Chair for
consideration at the meeting.</p>

<h5 id="dsmb-meeting-format">DSMB Meeting Format</h5>

<p>The recommended meeting format consists of three sessions: Open Session,
Closed Session, and Closed Executive Session.</p>

<p><strong>A. Open Session <em>(</em></strong><em>see
https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/data-and-safety-monitoring
for report template)</em>: This session is generally attended by the PI (s),
project statistician, external DSMB members, and the PO. The opens
session basically involves a complete review and discussion of all the
elements in the open session report presented in the aggregate for both
arms of the study.</p>

<p><strong>B. Closed Session <em>(</em></strong><em>see
https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/data-and-safety-monitoring
for report template)</em>: Generally only external voting members attend
this meeting. However the DSMB may invite others to participate. The
data reviewed in the closed session is similar to that presented in the
open session, but is presented by study-arm in a semi-blinded fashion.
For example, the arms are NOT identified by control or intervention, but
as group 1 and group 2. If a study has an interim analysis with a
pre-determined stopping rule, outcomes with statistical comparisons are
also discussed in the closed session.</p>

<p><strong>C. Closed Executive Session</strong>: This final session involves only DSMB
voting members to ensure complete objectivity as they discuss outcome
results, make decisions, and formulate recommendations regarding the
study. If treatment codes have been made accessible to the DSMB, then
the DSMB may unmask the data based on procedures identified in advance.</p>

<h5 id="voting">Voting</h5>

<p>To hold a vote, a quorum, as defined by the DSMB in the initial meeting,
must be present either in person or by conference call. After a thorough
discussion, the final recommendations of each DSMB member should be
solicited in Closed Executive Session. A consensus recommendation among
members is not required. The final recommendations are identified as
majority or minority positions and are accompanied by actual vote
tallies for each divergent recommendation, i.e., as number of votes for
or against a particular action, such as continuing or terminating a
study, etc.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the meeting, the DSMB sends their recommendations
to the PO and PI as to whether the study should continue without change,
be modified, or terminated. Recommendations could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Modifications of the study protocol</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suspension or early termination of the study or of one or more study
arms because of serious concerns about subjects’ safety, inadequate
performance or rate of enrollment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suspension or early termination of the study or of one or more study
arms because study objectives have been obtained according to
pre-established statistical guidelines</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Corrective actions regarding a study center whose performance
appears unsatisfactory or suspicious.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Investigator must submit the DSMBs summary report to the IRB and any
other site investigators for distribution to other IRBs as necessary as
soon as it is available. DSMB/C reports should include a statement
indicating that the data have been reviewed, the date of review and a
summary of specific findings of the research study. If it is an
FDA-regulated trial the summary report must be forwarded to the FDA.</p>

<h2 id="informed-consent">INFORMED CONSENT</h2>
<p>### What</p>

<p>Informed consent is the process by which a volunteer who wishes to
participate in a research study is informed about the study and agrees
to participate in the study. Informed consent is a process that
generally starts with the recruitment of volunteers and continues often
times throughout the course of a study.</p>

<p>Informed consent is a critical and complex regulatory component of human
subjects’ research, a full discussion of which goes beyond the scope of
this module. <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">Sections 45 CFR §46.116 and 45 CFR §46.117 of the Code of
Federal
Regulations</a>
Protection of Human Subjects
addresses informed consent. There are many other resources that provide
a thorough review of this topic, several of which, including the <a href="http://thehslhub/~/media/HSLNet/Docs/IFAR/IRB/IRB_SOP.ashx">HSL
IRB SOPs</a>
are provided at the end of the module.</p>

<h3 id="why-5">Why</h3>
<p>Informed consent is required under federal regulations for all
non-exempt research unless certain criteria are met to waive informed
consent requirements. The goal of the informed consent process is to
provide sufficient information so that participants can make informed
decisions about whether or not to enroll in a study or to continue or to
withdraw their participation.</p>

<h3 id="how-5">How</h3>
<p>#### Who Obtains Consent?</p>

<p>The act of consenting participants may be completed by a trained member
of the research team, often a research nurse or assistant. However, the
PI bears responsibility for ensuring that informed consent is obtained
properly.</p>

<h4 id="who-gives-consent">Who Gives Consent?</h4>

<p>Consent is usually obtained from intended participants. However when the
intended participant lacks decision making capacity (e.g., too ill or
cognitively impaired) consent may be obtained from the intended
participant’s proxy or “legally authorized representative” (LAR) under
certain circumstances.</p>

<h4 id="mode-of-consent">Mode of Consent</h4>

<p>The mode of obtaining consent varies depending on the nature of the
study and study population. The gold standard is written consent,
however obtaining written informed consent is not always feasible or the
best choice for the research project. In these cases, with the guidance
and approval of the IRB, some or all aspects of informed consent may be
altered or waived. See also
<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">45</a>
<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">CFR 46.116 sections C and D, and 45 CFR 46.117 section
C</a>
of the Code of Federal Regulations Protection of Human Subjects.</p>

<h5 id="written-informed-consent-forms">Written Informed Consent Forms</h5>

<p>A written consent form serves multiple purposes. It is a legal document
of consent, it can provide a helpful “script” during the process of
obtaining consent, and serves as a resource that participants can keep
and refer to throughout the study. Each institution’s IRB has specific
requirements and templates for written consent forms that must be
adhered to.</p>

<h5 id="waiver-of-consent">Waiver of consent</h5>

<p>There are very specific regulations that provide for circumstances under
which informed consent, or elements of informed consent, may be waived.
The determination of a waiver of consent is made by the overseeing IRB.
Also see <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">45 CFR 46.116 sections C and D, and 45 CFR 46.117 section
C</a>
of the Code of Federal Regulations Protection of Human Subjects.</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases, a waiver of consent is only possible for
clinical trials that meet the criteria for a “<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html#46.102">minimal
risk</a>”
study
as defined in the Code of Federal Regulation, Protection of Human
subjects at (<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.102">45 CFR
§46.102(i)</a>)
<em>“**Minimal risk means that
the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the
research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical
or psychological examinations or tests</em>.”</p>

<p>Whether or not a clinical trial meets criteria for a waiver of informed
consent has very important implications for the study design including
its timeline, budget, and personnel requirements. Thus, even in the
grant preparation stage you should consult with your IRB to get guidance
on this issue.</p>

<h4 id="special-situations-and-settings">Special Situations and Settings</h4>

<h5 id="informed-consent-in-cluster-rcts">Informed consent in cluster RCTs</h5>

<p>In <a href="http://www.cochrane-net.org/openlearning/html/modA2-4.htm">cluster RCTs
</a>the unit of
random assignment is a group (the “cluster”), such as a clinic,
hospital, physician practice or even a geographical region, rather than
an individual. This increasingly used design in health services research
raises many special ethical and regulatory considerations, including
informed consent. (See <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001346">The Ottawa Statement on Ethical Design and
Conduct of Cluster Randomized
Trials</a>,

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="special-considerations-for-older-subjects-5">Special considerations for older subjects</h3>

<p>Due to issues such as multiple and advanced illnesses, or impaired
capacity to consent to research, extra consideration needs to be made to

<h2 id="adverse-events-and-unanticipated-problems">ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS</h2>

<p>There are numerous entities under which there is regulatory guidance on
classifying and reporting unanticipated problems and adverse events
(AEs), including the prime IRB, OHRP, NIH, HHS, and FDA. Investigators
must be apprised of the guidelines specific to their IRB and agencies
overseeing the trial.</p>

<h3 id="pre-trial-preparation-for-adverse-event-monitoring-and-reporting">Pre-trial preparation for Adverse Event monitoring and reporting</h3>

<p>Investigators must include a plan for defining, detecting, monitoring
and reporting any AEs that might occur in study subjects, including the
type, probability and expected level of severity. The investigator
should include a risk profile of the proposed research study as well as
a description of how the risks of the research will be minimized and the
plan for safety monitoring. Additionally, a description of potential AEs
must be included in the manual of operating procedures, all
regulatory/human subjects documents, DSMB, and consent forms.</p>

<h3 id="reporting-processes-around-aes-and-unanticipated-problems">Reporting Processes around AEs and Unanticipated problems</h3>

<p>All AEs experienced by study participants and all unanticipated problems
must be documented and reported as described in the study protocol.
Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Unanticipated
Problems have specific definitions, reporting procedures and reporting
requirements that may vary by sponsor, internal IRB requirements and
study risk profile.</p>

<p>Detailed descriptions <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/adverse-events">NIAs requirements for reporting of the different

<h2 id="introduction-to-essential-documentation-in-a-randomized-clinical-trial">Introduction to Essential Documentation in a Randomized Clinical Trial</h2>

<h3 id="module-goal">Module Goal</h3>

<p>This module provides guidance for the development and management of
<em>essential</em> documentation before, during, and at the close of a
randomized clinical trial (RCT).</p>

<h3 id="general-considerations">General Considerations</h3>

<p>Documentation provides validation that research is conducted maintaining
the highest ethical and clinical standards as established by the World
Health Organization and the International Conference on Harmonization
(ICH) guidelines for Clinical Good Practice (GCP)</p>

<p>Documentation requirements will vary according to several factors, such
as intervention (e.g., drug, device, behavior), sponsor (e.g., NIH, drug
company), and regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA). Thus, you should
verify that your documentation plan complies with the specific your RCT.</p>

<p>The ICH GCP, section 8, “Essential Documents for the Conduct of a
Clinical Trial” provides a full listing of documents that are generally
deemed essential. These documents demonstrate that the trial conduct
complies with the standards of GCP and all regulatory requirements. This
module focuses on describing the following <strong>Essential Documents</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Study Protocol</li>
  <li>Manual of Operations</li>
  <li>Statistical Analytic Protocol</li>
  <li>Data Safety Monitoring Board Charter and Regular Reports (refer to
other chapter for details)</li>
  <li>Event Tracking</li>

<h2 id="protocol">Protocol</h2>
<p>### What
A study protocol describes the objective(s), design, methodology,
statistical considerations, and organization of an RCT. It is the core
document required for all parties who have responsibility for approval,
conduct, oversight, and analysis of the RCT. Key sections typically
include (also see template examples at the end of this module):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Background/rationale</li>
  <li>Objectives and purpose</li>
  <li>Study design</li>
  <li>Statement of qualifications</li>
  <li>Criteria for inclusion, exclusion, and withdrawal of study subjects</li>
  <li>Treatment /intervention</li>
  <li>Methods and timing for assessing, recording and analyzing data</li>
  <li>Methods for obtaining safety information and safety monitoring (Safety Monitoring Plan?)</li>
  <li>Statistical methods</li>
  <li>Ethical considerations</li>
  <li>Statement related to permitting RCT-related monitoring, audits, and
inspection by the sponsor, IEC/IRB, and regulators, including direct
access to source data/documents (Site monitoring plan?)</li>
  <li>Quality Control and Quality Assurance</li>
  <li>Data handling and record keeping (Data Management Plan?)</li>
  <li>Financing and Insurance</li>
  <li>Informed consent procedures</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-6">Why</h3>
<p>The detailed rationale and approach to clinical research documented and
maintained in the study protocol assures that the RCTs design and
implementation adhere to the integrity of the science and ensure the
validity of its findings. It is produced to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure feasibility of study design and objectives</li>
  <li>Ensure that study design will result in the collection of crucial
information</li>
  <li>Clarify study requirements and methodology for all partners</li>
  <li>Ensure approval of study by ethical committee(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>Over-seeing regulatory bodies, such as Internal Review Board (IRB), Data
Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), and National Institutes for Health
(NIH) will request to review the study protocol for approval prior to
starting the RCT, and may request the updated protocol at any point in
the RCT. Top tier journals will also request access to the protocol
prior to publication of the study’s findings.</p>

<h3 id="how-6">How</h3>
<p>The protocol must be completely written before the study begins. The
initial draft often requires input from several team members, but the
PI(s) should take responsibility for its final editing. It is a tedious
but necessary process. Any changes to the study conduct (i.e., Protocol
Amendments) must be meticulously documented and dated in a timely manner
in the protocol and in clinical trials.com as required. The final
protocol at the study’s end should reflect exactly what transpired
during the study’s conduct. The Project Director can serve as the main
organizer for maintaining the protocol and its updates under the PIs
supervision.</p>

<h3 id="special-considerations-for-older-subjects-7">Special considerations for older subjects</h3>
<p>None</p>

<h3 id="common-pitfalls-7">Common Pitfalls</h3>
<p>Common pitfalls include: incomplete or unclear initial protocols,
inadequate documentation of protocol amendments, and inconsistency with
other study key documents (e.g. manual of operations and IRB
applications).</p>

<h2 id="manual-of-operational-procedures">Manual of Operational Procedures</h2>
<p>### What</p>

<p>The Manual of Operational Procedures (MOP) is a handbook of instructions
designed to guide the research team to successfully carry out all
aspects of a particular research project according to that study’s
research protocol. It clearly spells out the “who, what, where, when and
how” of the RCT’s conduct. In general, the MOP transforms the protocol
into a description of the exact procedures involved to implement every
aspect of the RCT. Typically, each section of a MOP contains: steps
required for task completion, person responsible, and resources
required. Key sections typically include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>Protocol (embedded in to MOP)</li>
  <li>Study organization and responsibilities</li>
  <li>Human Subjects Protection</li>
  <li>Training plan</li>
  <li>Communications plan</li>
  <li>Study flow</li>
  <li>Eligibility and Recruitment</li>
  <li>Randomization</li>
  <li>Blinding and Unblinding</li>
  <li>Site Quality Management/Assurance</li>
  <li>Site Preparation</li>
  <li>Protocol Implementation</li>
  <li>Procedures for managing trial progress</li>
  <li>Test article</li>
  <li>Safety Assessment and Reporting</li>
  <li>Data Collection and Management</li>
  <li>Specimen and Laboratory Management</li>
  <li>Laboratory Quality Assurance</li>
  <li>Site Monitoring</li>
  <li>Regulatory Binder Maintenance</li>
  <li>Study completion and Close-out Procedures</li>
  <li>Appendices including:</li>
  <li>Study definitions</li>
  <li>List of abbreviations</li>
  <li>Adherence monitoring forms</li>
  <li>Data Collection Forms</li>
  <li>Copies of DSMB charter and report templates</li>
  <li>Statistical programming for key elements</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-7">Why</h3>

<p>The MOP is intended to serve as a study “cookbook”. The MOP facilitates
adherence to study protocol, organizes the conduct of the study, and
ensures consistency in research efforts throughout the study and across
study sites. In theory, another investigator should be able to replicate
the RCT’s conduct exactly as it was originally conducted by using the
MOP.</p>

<h3 id="how-7">How</h3>
<p>The MOP must be completely written before the study begins. The initial
draft requires input from several team members, particularly those
closest to the research component being operationalized in each section.
It is a tedious but necessary process. Any changes to the study
procedures must be meticulously documented and dated in a timely manner
in the MOP. The final MOP should reflect exactly what transpired during
the study’s conduct. A project director can serve as the main organizer
for maintaining the MOP and its updates under the PIs supervision.
Copies of the MOP should be available at study sites and in the main
study file system.</p>

<h3 id="special-considerations-for-older-subjects-8">Special considerations for older subjects</h3>
<p>None</p>

<h3 id="common-pitfalls-8">Common Pitfalls</h3>
<p>Common pitfalls for MOP development include: lack of adequate formatting
or tracking, lack of required appendices, and finding the right balance
of necessary detail to include.</p>

<h2 id="statistical-analytic-protocol">Statistical Analytic Protocol</h2>
<p>As the Statistical Analytical Plan (SAP) is an essential document, it
just briefly mentioned here. The details about developing and
maintaining a SAP are covered in Module XX.</p>

<h3 id="what">What</h3>
<p>A SAP is a document that contains a technical and detailed explanation
of the principal features of the analysis described in the study
protocol. It includes detailed procedures for executing the statistical
analysis of the primary and secondary variables and other data.</p>

<h3 id="why-8">Why</h3>
<p>Guidance on data ascertainment, management, storage, analysis and
interpretation are critical to preserve the validity of the design and
soundness of scientific conclusions.</p>

<h3 id="how-8">How</h3>
<p>Most often, the SAP and MOP are maintained as separate documents, but
sometimes the SAP is embedded into the MOP. The SAP must be assembled
prior to enrollment. It should be authored by the project statistician
in concert with investigative team. Any changes to the statistical
analytic plan related to the main outcomes must be clearly documented
and dated in a timely manner in the SAP. These changes must be conceived
and documented prior to the active phase of data analyses.</p>

<h2 id="data-safety-and-monitoring-documents">Data Safety and Monitoring Documents</h2>
<p>These are documents related to Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) (or
similar bodies such as a Data Safety Advisory Council (DSAC)) activities
within an RCT. Two main documents are required; the DSMB charter and
interim data reports.</p>

<h3 id="dsmbdsac-charter">DSMB/DSAC Charter</h3>
<p>#### What</p>

<p>The Charter describes the responsibilities of the DSMB. The charter also
defines the relationships between the DSMB and other parties responsible
for study oversight, including the sponsor, clinical research
organizations, steering committee, study investigators, IRBs/ECs,
appropriate regulatory agencies, and the DSMB management organization
(when applicable). Sections generally included in the charter include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Role of DSMB</li>
  <li>DSMB Responsibilities</li>
  <li>Membership</li>
  <li>Board Process</li>
  <li>Meeting format</li>
  <li>Meeting materials/ reports</li>
  <li>DSMB meeting minutes/reports</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-9">Why</h4>

<p>The purpose of the charter is to define the responsibilities of the
DSMB, detail membership requirements, describe the data to be reviewed,
delineate the meeting process, and outline the considerations and
policies of the DSMB.</p>

<h4 id="how-9">How</h4>

<p>The charter should be developed and approved by all parties responsible
for study oversight, including the PI, the DSMB members and the sponsor
(e.g., NIH Project Officer). If your trial is funded by the NIH, talk
with your Project Officer about his/her preference for who should take
the lead in developing the charter. There are general guidelines and
many templates available (see Resources below). If funded by the NIH,
the Project Officer may recommend a preferred format or template.</p>

<h4 id="special-considerations-for-older-subjects-9">Special Considerations for Older Subjects</h4>

<p>None</p>

<h4 id="common-pitfalls-9">Common Pitfalls</h4>

<p>Common pitfalls for DSMB charter development include a lack of adequate
planning or corroboration with DSMB members and sponsor and insufficient
information inclusion.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interim-data-reports">Interim Data Reports</h3>
<p>#### What</p>

<p>Interim data reports provide members of the DSMB with information to
allow them to evaluate safety, study conduct, scientific validity and
integrity of the trial. The reports convey data of relevant study
activities and outcomes as agreed upon at the outset as in the purview
of the DSMB. There are two types of the interim reports produced; one
for the open session of the DSMB, and one for the closed session <em>(see
Module XX).</em> . Sections generally included in these reports are listed
below. Those marked by an asterisk are usually only included in the open
report and not repeated in the closed reports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Report Summary</li>
  <li>Protocol Synopsis</li>
  <li>Organizational chart</li>
  <li>DSMB Roster</li>
  <li>Brief statement of trial purpose</li>
  <li>Primary Trial Outcome</li>
  <li>Projected timetable and schedule</li>
  <li>List of participating clinics, data centers, resource centers</li>
  <li>Study status</li>
  <li>Facility recruitment and subject accrual status</li>
  <li>Data quality</li>
  <li>Safety assessments (e.g., adverse events)</li>
  <li>Protocol Deviations</li>
  <li>Outcomes (may or may not be included)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="open-session-report">Open Session Report</h5>

<p>The open session report provides information on study conduct,
including: recruitment and demographic data, subject/facility
characteristics, protocol compliance, site performance, quality control,
adverse event data, and outcome data when appropriate aggregated for
both arms of the RCT (i.e.. all subjects).</p>

<h5 id="closed-session-report">Closed Session Report</h5>

<p>The closed session report contains data similar to that presented in the
open session report but is presented separately for each study arm in a
semi-blinded fashion. For example, the arms are NOT identified by
control or intervention, but as group 1 and group 2. If a study has an
interim analysis with a pre-determined stopping rule, outcomes with
statistical comparisons are also presented in the closed session.</p>

<h4 id="why-10">Why</h4>

<p>To provide a clear representation of trial activity to ensure
participant safety and data integrity and to inform DSMB recommendations
related to study continuation.</p>

<h4 id="how-10">How</h4>

<p>Prior to starting the study, the PI, and Statistician should work with
the DSMB members and the Project Officer to draft a report outline using
recommended guidelines or templates. Once approved by all parties,
additions or modifications to these reports may be directed by the DSMB
as the study progresses.</p>

<p>The research team prepares the data for the DSMB reports which should be
sent to DSMB members 1 to 2 weeks prior to the meeting to allow
sufficient time for review. There are software applications such as that
can be automated to fill in the recurring data needed for these reports
(see Data Management module).</p>

<p>The Closed Session Report is confidential. Printed copies of this report
should be destroyed after the meeting. Procedures for securing and
eliminating closed reports distributed to telephone and video conference
participants should be specified in advance of the meeting.</p>

<h2 id="regulatory-binder">Regulatory Binder</h2>
<p>### What</p>

<p>The Regulatory Binder is an indexed collection of essential documents
relevant to the RCT. While frequently referred to as a regulatory
binder, it may also be called: Study Files, Investigator Files or
Investigator Binder. ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (GCP) list
documents generally considered essential for inclusion in the regulatory
binder. The basic sections of a regulatory binder include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IRB Information/Protocol Review Correspondence</li>
  <li>Study Protocol and Supporting Documents</li>
  <li>Informed Consent Forms and Supporting Documents</li>
  <li>Source Documents</li>
  <li>Case Report Forms (CRFs) / Data Collection Tools</li>
  <li>Study Participant logs</li>
  <li>Adverse Events &amp; Unanticipated Problems</li>

<h3 id="why-11">Why</h3>
<p>A complete regulatory binder allows ready access to all materials that
reflect regulatory compliance and adherence to the ethical standards for
Good Clinical Practice. The regulatory binder is often the first thing
reviewed during audits and inspections.</p>

<h3 id="how-11">How</h3>
<p>The PI and Project Director (PD) should compile a list of all essential
documents specific to the RCT as indicated by the sponsors and
regulatory authorities. Many sponsors supply investigators with binders
and organization strategies (see Resources). Additionally NIH provides a
regulatory binder checklist.Harvard Catalyst provides a template for a
regulatory binder (http://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/regbinder/).</p>

<p>The Project Director should be responsible for the creation and
maintenance of the binder under the PI’s supervision. It is helpful to
include a section in the MOP about the regulatory binder/file management
addressing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creation/required documents</li>
  <li>Location of various components when study is on-going</li>
  <li>Updating frequency and responsibility</li>
  <li>Management/storage of outdated documents and retention requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>The regulatory binder may take the form of one or more physical binders,
located in one or more physical locations. It may also take the form of
an indexed collection of electronic documents maintained on a study
website or shared file. Physical binders should be labeled (cover and
spine) with the protocol number, PI name, and study site. Use multiple
binders or master binders to maintain documentation as needed.</p>

<p>Access to the various sections of the binder may be controlled based on
role in the study and status related to study blinding.</p>

<h1 id="data-sharing-and-publication">Data Sharing and Publication</h1>

<h2 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h2>
<p>Research dissemination can be defined as follows: “A planned process
that involves consideration of target audiences and the settings in
which research findings are to be received and, where appropriate,
communicating and interacting with wider policy and health service
audiences in ways that will facilitate research uptake in decision-
making processes and practice”. <em>Wilson et al, Implementation Science
2010, 5:91</em></p>

<p>Traditionally, research dissemination centers on the publication of
results in peer reviewed journals and academic conference presentations.
Recent initiatives seek to broaden the concept of research dissemination
such that the main messages from results are communicated to targeted
decision-makers and stakeholders in a way that encourages them to factor
the research implications into their work and clinical practice. This
module will focus on two aspects of dissemination particularly relevant
to Clinical Trials: 1. Data sharing and 2. Publication in scientific
journals</p>

<p>Regardless of the scope, researchers are encouraged to <em>develop a
dissemination plan early in the course of all trials.</em> Trials that are
closer to later phases of research translation (i.e., implementation)
and those supported by certain agencies (e.g., Patient-Centered Outcomes
Research Institute (PCORI)) may require more robust dissemination plans
in grant applications that go beyond traditional journal publications
and meeting presentations.</p>

<h2 id="data-sharing">Data Sharing</h2>
<p>### What
To maximize transparency and investment, policymakers seek to expand
public and investigator access to clinical trial data. The extent of
data sharing can range from sharing aggregated data describing subject
characteristics and outcomes, to providing de-identified patient-level
data. Data sharing requirements depend on evolving policies of funding
agencies (i.e., NIH) and other regulators. <em>Researchers are strongly
encouraged to consult the most up-to-date requirements as early as
possible in planning of their clinical trial (see section 2.3 below).</em></p>

<h3 id="why-12">Why</h3>
<p>The intent of data sharing is to maximize the transparency and benefits
of research. Moreover, some level of data sharing for clinical trials is
often required by regulatory authorities, funding agencies and the
ICMJE.</p>

<p>When done appropriately, data sharing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increases public trust by increasing transparency of research
efforts</li>
  <li>Maximizes the public health impact of research</li>
  <li>Encourages scientific inquiry and new research efforts</li>
  <li>Encourages diversity of analysis and opinion</li>
  <li>Permits the creation of new datasets when data from multiple sources
are combined</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-12">How</h3>

<p>In September 2016 the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
issued a new regulation and the NIH has issued a new policy to increase
the availability of information about clinical trials.  The HHS <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/21/2016-22129/clinical-trials-registration-and-results-information-submission">Final
Rule</a>
describes requirements for registering and submitting summary results
information for certain clinical trials to
<a href="file:///C:\Users\elainebergman\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary%20Internet%20Files\Content.Outlook\SJPDZYVY\ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. 
A complimentary <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/21/2016-22379/dissemination-of-nih-funded-clinical-trial-information">NIH
policy</a>
that applies to all clinical trials funded by NIH, regardless of whether
they are subject to the Final Rule was also published today. The Final
NIH Policy was also published in the <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-149.html">NIH Guide for Grants and
Contracts</a>.</p>

<p>NIH has made available the following resources to help explain these

<h4 id="methods-for-data-sharing">Methods for Data Sharing</h4>

<p>There are numerous approaches to data sharing, each of which has
different levels of privacy protection and mechanisms for sharing.
Researchers can manage requests for data personally on an individual
request basis, or through use of a secure data archive or enclave.
Investigators should select a mode of data sharing that is appropriate
based on the size, complexity and sensitivity of the data, as well as
the volume of data use requests anticipated. See the <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_guidance.htm#methods">NIH data sharing
guidance</a>
for details.</p>

<p>The NIH provides numerous <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_repositories.html">data sharing
repositories</a>
which make data accessible for reuse. If you are doing an NIH funded
trial, consult your Project Officer to discuss options for sharing data.</p>

<p>IFAR has created several sensitive data policies (including data access,
encryption, sharing, security, suppression, retention and destruction,
etc.) please see these policies on the <a href="http://thehslhub/Departments/Roslindale/HSL-IFAR/Administration/Policies-and-Forms">HSL HUB policy and
forms</a>.</p>

<h4 id="human-subjects-and-privacy-issues">Human Subjects and Privacy Issues</h4>

<p>All data sharing activities must be compliant with HIPAA, local, state
and organizational regulations. All compliances and restrictions should
be addressed in the data sharing plan section of the funding
application. There are two basic approaches to protecting sensitive
data: restricting information in the shared dataset, and restricting
access to the data. See <a href="file:///\\hebrewseniorlife.local\home\research-users\ElaineBergman\ISAC\Data%20Sharing%20Publication%20and%20dissemination">NIH data sharing
guidance</a>
(<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_guidance.htm#methods">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_guidance.htm#methods</a>)
for details.</p>

<p>The plan for data sharing may include stripping a dataset of all
potential participant identifiers. Depending on the data and study
population, the level of information that will need to be removed from
the database varies. Studies involving participants with unusual
characteristics (Samples drawn from small geographic areas, rare
populations, and linked datasets) will likely involve a greater degree
of anonymizing to ensure the privacy of study participants.</p>

<p>Data archives and enclaves can be set up to restrict access at any
level. Data Use Agreements restrict the use of data to those
specifically identified in the agreement, and require that data be used
only for research purposes.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="http://thehslhub/Departments/Roslindale/HSL-IFAR/Administration/Policies-and-Forms">IFAR policy on Limited Data Sets and Data Use

<h2 id="scientific-publications-and-presentations">Scientific Publications and Presentations</h2>
<p>### General Considerations
All paper and abstracts emanating from your trial should be planned
early on in the study to maximize the productivity from the trial and
avoid iterative papers. In planning, it is useful to outline the topic
of paper, target journal and responsible first author.</p>

<p>Larger trials should have a <em>Publications Steering Committee</em> whose
members are usually the lead investigators and establish written
guidelines for vetting papers emanating from the trial. This procedure
for planning, reviewing and approving all scientific publications
(papers and abstracts) prior to submission to ensure they are accurate
(i.e., align with protocol), not duplicative, and respect ICMJE
authorship guidelines. Certain funding agencies and industry sponsors
trials may have very specific requirements regarding their own review
and approval of manuscripts prior to submission.</p>

<p>Section III of the <a href="https://www.acrin.org/RESEARCHERS/POLICIES/PUBLICATIONSPOLICY/PUBLICATIONSPOLICYDOCUMENT.aspx">ACRIN publication
policy</a>
provides details related to the roles and responsibilities of
publication committees.</p>

<h3 id="specific-reporting-guidelines-for-clinical-trials">Specific Reporting Guidelines for Clinical Trials</h3>
<p>Clinical trials reporting has specific standard guidelines that differ
by the type of trial design and which are continually being updated. For
example, there are set standards for the flow diagrams presenting
subject participation in a clinical trial that differ between
traditional parallel design randomized trials, non-inferiority trials,
cluster randomized trials, stepped wedge designs etc. Journals generally
follow the guidelines described in the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/"><strong>CONSORT</strong> (Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials)
statement</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.equator-network.org/">EQUATOR</a> (Enhancing the QUAlity
and Transparency Of health Research)
is also a very useful comprehensible searchable website with up-to-date
links the CONSORT statements and extensions.</p>

<h3 id="publication-of-the-trial-protocol">Publication of the trial protocol</h3>
<p>#### What
Protocol manuscripts report the methodology of your clinical trial.
Details in a published protocol paper (e.g., primary and secondary
outcome definitions, sample size estimates) need to align with other
official communications describing the study’s methodology such as the
trial protocol and descriptions in ClinicalTrials.gov. These documents
may be compared by journals considering publication of the trial’s
results and discrepancies will need to be explained.</p>

<h4 id="why-13">Why</h4>
<p>Reasons to publish a protocol paper include increasing transparency of
the trial conduct, providing a detailed reference for future
publications emanating from the study, and demonstrating productivity
for funding agencies.</p>

<h4 id="how-13">How</h4>
<p>Planning for a protocol manuscript submission should begin early because
journals generally only consider publishing protocol papers for studies
that have received ethics approval but have not yet concluded patient
recruitment.</p>

<h4 id="selecting-a-journal">Selecting a Journal</h4>
<p>Examples of journals that publish protocol papers include: Clinical
Trials: Journal of the Society of Clinical Trials, Contemporary Clinical
Trials, International Journal of Clinical Trials, Journal of Clinical
Trials, BMJ, and Trials. Some of these journal allow authors to pay for
publication of their protocol paper (e.g., Journal of Clinical Trials)
and others have the option of paying for open access should the paper be
accepted.</p>

<p>In deciding which journal is the most appropriate to publish your
protocol, it is useful to first review prior protocol papers published
in specific journals to see which best aligns with your study and
examine their formats. All journals will have specific guidelines for
preparation which should be carefully consulted and adhered to.</p>

<h3 id="publication-of-the-results-of-a-clinical-trial">Publication of the results of a clinical trial</h3>
<p>#### Timing
The <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/results/reporting/en/">WHO Statement on Public Disclosure of Clinical Trial
Results</a> states, at a minimum,
main findings of clinical trials, positive or negative, are to be
submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal within 12 months of
study completion and are to be published through an open access
mechanism unless there is a specific reason why open access cannot be
used, or otherwise made available publicly at most within 24 months of
study completion.</p>

<h4 id="trial-registration-identification">Trial Registration Identification</h4>
<p>As per the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/preparing-for-submission.html">ICMJE
guidelines</a>,
top-tier journals require that your trial be registered on
<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>
(<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a>) (or equivalent such as <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html">WHO
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
(ICTRP)</a>) prior
to the enrollment of the first subject, otherwise the paper will be
rejected without review. The trial registration number must be included
in your manuscript and usually appears at the end of the abstract.</p>

<p>The ICMJE encourages posting of clinical trial results in clinical trial
registries. The ICMJE will not consider as prior publication the posting
of trial results in any registry that meets the above criteria if
results are limited to a brief (500 word) structured abstract or tables
(to include patients enrolled, key outcomes, and adverse events).</p>

<h4 id="packaging-results">Packaging results</h4>
<p>Investigators are cautioned to carefully plan the paper (s) emanating
from a single trial to avoid iterative publications, ensure the main
trial results are not usurped by early papers, and to adhere with the
pre-specified analyses set forth in the trial protocol and as described
on ClinicalTrials.gov. One should reserve the main paper to include the
pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes. <em>“Outcome switching”
(i.e., changing the outcomes reported in results paper with those
pre-specified in the protocol and on ClinicalTrials.gov) must be
avoided.</em></p>

<p>Following publication of the main paper, non-iterative auxiliary papers
that leverage the rich clinical trials data may be considered.</p>

<h4 id="manuscript-preparation">Manuscript Preparation</h4>
<p>All manuscripts should adhere to the guidelines provided in each
journals’ Instructions for Authors which generally follow <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/preparing-for-submission.html">ICMJE
guidelines</a>
(<a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/preparing-for-submission.html">http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/preparing-for-submission.html</a>)</p>

<p>Most journals which have a specific reporting criteria for clinical
trials results manuscripts which generally follow the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT
statement</a>
(<a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</a>). CONSORT provides an extremely
useful
<a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/checklists/view/32-consort/66-title">checklist</a>
(<a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/checklists/view/32-consort/66-title">http://www.consort-statement.org/checklists/view/32-consort/66-title</a>)
to help guide presentation of every element of a clinical trial
manuscript and is a <strong><em>highly recommended resource.</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="adjunct-material">Adjunct material</h4>
<p>Most top tier journals will request a copy of the trial protocol with
the submission of the paper describing the clinical trial results.
Editors will compare the details in the protocol, ClinicalTrials.gov and
any previously published protocol papers, with those described in the
submitted manuscript to ensure they align.</p>
