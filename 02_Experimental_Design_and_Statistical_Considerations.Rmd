# Experimental Design and Statistical Considerations

## Introduction

### What

Experimental design encompasses features of a clinical trial that relate to its structure and operations.

### Why

Careful planning and documentation of design of a clinical intervention study is critical for maintenance of rigor and the obtaining of results that are likely to be reproducible. These considerations are intimately connected to the trial's appropriateness for formal statistical analysis and production of results. It is thus imperative that all aspects of design receive the highest level of scrutiny during the planning phase.

### How

It is critical that aspects of design be tailored to the goals and specific aims of the trial. Below we delineate aspects of experimental and statistical design that should be considered. These are not to be considered comprehensive or as being equally applicable to all scenarios, but should provide a starting point in planning your study. 

## Design of the study

### What 

In this toolkit we consider explicitly randomized experiments conducted with human subjects, most typically clinical trials. 

### Why 

Key design features will ultimately dictate the internal validity and generalizability of trial results. 

### How 

The following items should be considered during the design phase.

1. __Rationale for conduct of the trial.__ The scientific / biomedical impetus necessitating conduct of the trial. 
2. __Overall goal.__ What, specifically, the study is intended to accomplish. Investigators should note the degree to which the trial will be considered **explanatory** (that is, focused on estimation of pure causal effects of intervention under controlled circumstances) versus **pragmatic** (focused on choosing between therapeutic options, often under circumstances mimicing or derived directly from clinical experience.) Many studies will have both explanatory and pragmatic aims. 
3. __Illness condition or state.__ The condition modification of which motivates the study.
4. __Sampling population.__ Individuals on whom sampling should focus, including explicit requirements for inclusion and factors that would preclude enrollment (exclusions).
5. __General approach to design.__ Determination of the general nature of the approach to determining intervention efficacy and safety. For instance, the trial may be intended to demonstrate **superiority,** **noninferiority** or **equivalence** of a novel intervention to standard care; to determine **maximum tolerable dose** of a particular agent in a given population; to demonstrate a **dose-response** relation between intervention dosing and endpoints; etc. 
6. __Specific aims.__ Detailed aims addressable by evaluation of statistical hypotheses.
7. __Primary and secondary endpoints.__
8. __General nature of the planned comparisons.__ Key features of the comparisons to be made; e.g. mean performance on a primary endpoint.
9. __Safety concerns.__ Risks, including loss of confidentiality, affiliated with intervention or trial activities. Note that these will be explicitly considered by Institutional Review Board in assessing the risk/benefit ratio of conduct of the trial.
10. __Ethical considerations.__ Additional safety of ethical considerations.
11. __Measurement and quantification of effects.__ The way in which treatment effects will be quantified.
12. __Determination of statistical significance of comparisons.__ Summary nature of quantitative comparisons, fleshed out in statistical analysis plan.
13. __Study staffing and environment.__
    i. __Leadership.__ Designation of membership and roles of investigative team leaders.
    ii. __Staffing.__ Designation of study staff, with specific delineation of responsibilities.
    iii. __Environment.__ Physical space in which the study will be conducted. Explicitly considers access and travel to and from the venue, as appropriate.
14. __Measurement.__ Detailed explication of the was in which measurements will be taken. Makes specific note of resource needs (for instance, whether images or biospecimens must be collected or stored, and the equipment, facilities and human resources necessray to obtain said measures.)
15. __Nature and administration of intervention.__ Specific detail on the intervention, including how, how frequently, and by whom it will be administered and monitored.
16. _Study intervention period._ Length of time over which intervention would be administered, including run-in and washout periods as applicable.
17. __Frequency of participant interactions, data collection and endpoint measurement.__ Number and frequency of participant interactions and measurments; often displayed in tabular format.
18. __Participant allocation or randomization.__ Methods by which participants will be assigned to trial arms, e.g. by randomization. Detail on the specific procedures used to determine these assignments. Must consider factors (e.g. blocking or stratification) that affect this process.
19. __Masking / blinding.__ Determination of whether and how investigators, staff, participants, analysts etc. are aware of intervention assignments. 
20. __Data collection and management.__ Detail on the physical systems for data capture, methods by which it will be captured, the persons performing entry, monitoring of data completeness and quality, etc (see [Data Management](https://ifar-isac.github.io/book/data-management.html) Module).
21. __Statistical design and sample size.__ See below.
22. __Measurement of trial adherence.__ Methods by which completeness of planned participant interactions with randomized activities will be quantified, and plans for analysis, if any.
23. __Training.__ Provisions for training of study personnel, including human resources for providing the trainging.

### Special considerations for older adults

The number of participants available and who would likely consent to be enrolled in trials can be difficult to estimate among older individuals, particularly in the context of numerous exclusionary factors. 

### Common pitfalls

Lack of specificity in describing intervention; insufficient attention to the potential for attrition, data missingness, or intervention non-adherence; lack of detail in considering manner by which participants may be contacted, recruited, and maintained in the trial.

## General Statistical Considerations 

### What

The statistical design works hand-in-hand with the experimental design to establish procedures for data interpretation and analysis. Major considerations include planning the enrollment and sample size, the general analytic approach, a priori consideration of the way in which results will be interpreted, and plans to resolve expected and unexpected problems, including data missingness and untoward measurements. 

### Why

Appropriate sample size and a statistical analysis plan are critical for the validity of conclusions and to prevent bias in operations and conclusions. 

### How

Derivation of the statistical analysis plan is detailed in the sections below. 

## Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)

### What

The project Statistical Analysis Plan (**SAP**) provides detailed descriptions of statistical analyses to be conducted for the trial, including rationale for choice of methods, plans for dealing with unexpected difficulties, and pre-specified guidance on interpretation of results.

### Why

Guidance on data ascertainment, management, storage, analysis and interpretation are critical to preserve the validity of the design and soundness of scientific conclusions.

### How

A version of the SAP may be included as an addendum to or embedded within the study protocol and manual of procedures, but ideally the authoritative SAP should be an independent document with its own formatting, references etc. The SAP must be assembled prior to enrollment and approved by the appropriate parties including the trial statistician, investigative team, and regulatory authorities (e.g. DSMB), and may be included with the package submitted to Institutional Review Boards or equivalent overseeing ethical approval of the trial. Authorship should be by the project statistician, assisted by the investigative team. As with all trials documents, the SAP should be under strict version control, and a 'living' electronic date-stamped version considered the authoritative document (see 
[Essential Documentations](https://ifar-isac.github.io/book/essential-documentations.html) Module).

### Special considerations for older adults

Aging populations are subject to a number of factors that may induce bias or difficulty in analysis, including enhanced risk of attrition or competing risks, elevated prevalence of multimorbidity, difficulties with participant recall, and other factors [cite Van Ness et al]. These and related considerations must be carefully considered within the SAP and during analysis.

### Common pitfalls

Lack of specificity in describing techniques to be used and controlling decisions. Examples: failure to specify method by which standard errors are to be computed (model-based vs. robust. vs. resampling-based methods), failure to specify the set of covariates to be used in the definitive analysis (or method by which that set of covariates will be derived).

## Presentation of Pre-planned Statistical Analyses

### What

Presentation of statistical analyses to collaborators within the trial can range from casual exploratory communications to formal presentation of results as described in the SAP. In general, formal inference should follow the pre-specified plan laid out in the SAP, with particular attention to maintenance of blinding and the potential for introduction of bias, and investigators should consult regulations and guidance as to the degree to which discussion of preliminary analyses by the investigative team are appropriate. Formal presentation of results should follow an established template consistent with the SAP and include critical elements as outlined below.

### Why

Protection against confirmation bias and other hazards is critical for the maintenance of rigor and validity of conclusions. Following the agreed-upon template for analyses (as documented in the SAP) provides this protection.

### How

Analyses should be presented in memoranda constructed in a reproducible fashion, with carefully managed version control and documentation of data sources and other items as described below. Authorship should be a collaboration between the study statistician and other members of the analytic team, and must have as a contributor the persons actually performing the analysis.

#### Contents of the document

Some critical items for inclusion are described below

1. __Introduction and objectives.__ Brief background for the proposed analysis, with particular attention to measurement or design issues relevant to the presentation of results.
    a. _Data Sources._ Describes the studies and data set/s used. Must specify the version of the data structures (i.e. the date upon which the dataset was frozen and/or transmitted to the analyst.
    b. _Software and computing environment._ Describes the analytic tools and machinery employed, including version numbers.
    c. _Aims and Analysis Objectives._ Briefly states the aims and hypothesis of the analysis. Includes a brief prose summary how each aim was addressed in the analyses.
2. __Methods.__ Describes analytic sample and methods employed.
    a. _Analytic samples and timeframe._ Defines samples used. Specifies any subgroups to be used in analysis.  Specifies the analysis timeframe (i.e. which visits or measurements were incorporated in analysis).

## Planning, Conduct and Presentation of Secondary Analyses

Following or in parallel to completion of pre-planned analyses, secondary analyses may be requested or conducted. It is recommended that the trial employ a template for request and design of these analyses that mirrors the structure of the report described in the [Contents of the document](#contents-of-the-document-1) section.
